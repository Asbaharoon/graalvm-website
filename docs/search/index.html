Support retrieving annotations from class initializers (see 1320).  Fixed problems related to the freetype library: 1269, 1270, 1305.  Fixed Version string reporting (it was missing 64-Bit in the string).Native image  Fixed IllegalArgumentException: Cannot create Method for class initializer (see 1320).  Fixed an issue when the build would loop forever if META-INF/native-image/native-image.properties contains --force-fallback.  Fixed the issue where fallback image generation would not respect the --no-server argument.  Fix native-image-agent=restrict configuration detection.  Added -agentlib:native-image-agent=build configuration option.LLVM interpreterAllow LLVM interpreter Context to run without allowIO(true).19.0.0(2019-05-09)Early Adopter Windows SupportThe early adopter builds for Windows are available for GraalVM. These includethe JDK with the GraalVM compiler enabled, the Native Image capabilities,GraalVM’s JavaScript engine and the developer tools: Chrome inspector baseddebugger, Profiler etc.. Currently there is no gu utility or the ability toadd support for the other GraalVM languages.Java  We updated the base JDK to 8u212. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.Native ImageNative Image was extracted from the base GraalVM distribution. Currently it isavailable as an early adopter plugin. To install it, run: gu installnative-image. After this additional step, the native-image executable will bein the bin directory, as for the previous releases.There was a change in how classes are initialized in a native-image. Now, we initialize application classes at run time by default. The policy for initialization is as follows:  All JDK classes are initialized at build time.  We prove the safety of application static initializers after the analysis and initialize the safe classes.  We provide the following flags to control class initialization in a fine-grained way: --initialize-at-build-time and --initialize-at-run-time.The performance and startup impact of this change is negligible on all benchmarks that we have.This change was made to improve user experience: there is no need to writesubstitutions and to deal with instances of unsupported classes ending up in theimage heap. Their applications, given the right configuration for reflection,proxies, etc., should work without performance degradation.To allow framework authors and end users to keep the startup time at minimum weimproved functionality of --initialize-at-build-time and--initialize-at-run-time. These flags allow to specify a policy for wholepackages or individual classes. For example, if we have classes p.C1, p.C2,… , p.Cn, we can eagerly initialize this package with--initalize-at-build-time=p. If we want to delay one of the classes in packagep we can simply add --initialize-at-run-time=p.C1.The whole class hierarchy can be initialized at build time by simply passing --initalize-at-build-time on the command line.We also introduced the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization which allows you to track what class initialization does during the image build. This flag will help you configure the build to work as intended.What should I do if I am a library author?  To get your tests back in check you can use --intialize-at-build-time which will revert to the previous behaviour.  Then use the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization to see when classes get initialized. Based on this output you can make the proper configuration.  Configure your native-image.properties by passing --intialize-at-build-time=&amp;lt;csv-of-classes-or-packages&amp;gt; to it.  Submit a pull request to the downstream libraries with the configuration you believe works well. That way your native-image.properties will be concerned only with the classes from your framework.  There is a known issue with lambdas being initialized at build time. If your lambda inherits an interface with a default method and static fields, those fields will get pulled into the image. We will provide a fix to this bug in the next two weeks.JavaScript  Fixed various bugs that address compilation problems.R  Fixed a fatal error on Linux platforms when sending SIGINT during long computations.  Fixed issues with the installation to protected locations: the default Renviron file sets the R_LIBS_USER to a directory inside the current user’s home. Users still have to create this directory manually. Alternatively, the configure_fastr script creates the directory, but for the current user only.  Implemented missing C API: S_realloc.Ruby  Various bug fixes. Most notably fixes around OpenSSL C extension compilation.  Renamed methods in the TruffleRuby object.Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)  Fixed the issue with the ASTs and call trees not showing up.",

                    "content": "19.1.1(2019-07-16)This is a Critical Patch Update (CPU) release for the 19.1.0 GraalVM releaseinduced by the update to OracleJDK 8u221 and OpenJDK 8u222 as the base JDKs.More details can be foundhereand here. We recommend upgradingto it from the 19.1.x and older releases.This CPU release includes fixes for the following CVEs:  CVE-2019-2813  CVE-2019-2862For more information please see the Oracle July 2019 Security Advisory.Critical fixes to GraalVM Native Image listed below went also into this version:      Fixed Reflection.getCallerClass methods sometimes failing to acquire the correct frame in the native images (#1479).        Fixed an issue that could cause header files not being generated in the working directory when compiling shared libraries ahead-of-time.  19.1.0(2019-07-02)This is a feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.0.x releases.Java  Improved speed of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in GraalVM, which significantlyimproves the performance on medium length workloads.  Applied profile-guided optimization (PGO) when building the ahead-of-time (AOT) image of the compiler. This enables more aggressive optimization of the compiler itself providing better compilation throughput.Native imageWe fixed many issues that were reported on GitHub. You can browse the full list here.JavaScript  Added an experimental option js.locale to set the default locale for locale-sensitive operations.  Allow making evaluated sources internal using the sourceURL directive by prefixing the URL with internal:, e.g., //# sourceURL=internal:myname.js.  Improved code sharing across threads. Prior to this one context had to be closed before the code in it could be reused in another context , now for JavaScript contexts one can share code using ContextPolicy.SHARED without closing the context.In the following example the source code is shared between context1 and context2:public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Engine engine = Engine.create()) {            Source source = Source.create(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);            try (              Context context1 = Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build();              Context context2 = Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build()) {                context1.eval(source).asInt();                context2.eval(source).asInt();            }        }    }LLVM interpreter  Calling exit(...) in an embedded context is now a catchable PolyglotException.  Skip source path entries that we are not allowed to access. Previously, whenrunning in an embedded context with restricted access to the file system, theLLVM engine threw an exception when it could not read the source files, even ifno debugger was attached. Now it will still run. Only when a debugger isattached, an error is reported when the source file can’t be accessed.RubyThe GraalVM Ruby implementation in this version targets performance and compatibility improvements, new features implementations and multiple bug fixes. The most notable include:  Interactive sources (like the GraalVM polyglot shell) now all share the same binding (#1695).  Hash code calculation has been improved to reduce hash collisions for Hash and other cases.  eval(code, binding) for a fixed code containing blocks is now much faster. This improves the performance of rendering ERB templates containing loops.  rb_str_cat is faster due to the C string now being concatenated without first being converted to a Ruby string or having its encoding checked.A complete changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub.R  Strings -Inf, +NaN, and -NaN are correctly parsed to doubles including ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces.  For loop creates and initializes the control variable even if there are no iterations (#77).  Updated the output of the capabilities builtin (#78).  is.function returns true for foreign executables.The complete project changelog is available on GitHub.Python  Updated Python standard library files from 3.7.0 to 3.7.3.  Improved performance of exceptions that do not escape.  Fixed caching of core sources in a native image with a preinitialized contextfor pre-built images and libpolyglot fast startup.  Implemented support for pwd.getpwuid, os.exec, os.execv, and os.execl modules.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.",

                    "content": "19.2.1(2019-10-15)This is a Critical Patch Update (CPU) for GraalVM Enterprise and CommunityEditions following a regular Oracle CPUs cycle. The updateis to address security vulnerabilities announced in the October 2019 Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory. The 19.2.1 version is a full distribution and and it is recommended to upgrade to it from older GraalVM versions.Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition 19.2.1 includes all the Java security fixes released as part of that CPU and mentioned in the Java SE 8 Release notes.  It also includes the following:  Update GraalVM Enterprise base Java to the 8u231 Oracle JDK version  Update GraalVM Community base Java to the 8u232 OpenJDK version  Update Node.js to 10.16.3Listed below are critical fixes that also went into this version:  Fixed a problem that prevented creating a native image including the GraalVM JavaScript engine combined with java.lang.CharSequence implementations that have non-trivial implementations of the length and charAt methods (see #1625).  Fixed a problem that could allow an exception to propagate past a catch clause that should handle it.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers can use GraalVM Enterprise environment in their cloud instances by simply installing it with yum. For more details, please seeGraalVM on OCI. Note: We currently do not recommend macOS users to upgrade to Catalina – a next majorrelease of macOS desktop operating system. We can not guarantee completecompatibility with GraalVM 19.2.1 or older versions yet.19.2.0.1(2019-09-13)We prepared a high severity update for GraalVM to address the following issues:  Fixed a critical compiler bug that caused String.indexOf to be executed incorrectly on older machines that do not support the TZCNT instruction. The problem causes incorrect string operations and typically shows up as truncated string values.  Fixed a bug causing the bounds check in Native Image’s implementation of System.arraycopy to overflow with large indices which typically causes process termination.  Fixed a bounds check for System.arraycopy in cases where the array is “virtualized” (i.e., can be in registers and stack slots instead of on the heap).  Removed declaration of otherwise unused SIOCGSTAMP symbol in Native Image. This allows use of Native Image on any Linux distro using a 5.2.x kernel such as the latest versions of Fedora, Ubuntu (except LTS release users), Arch, openSUSE (tumbleweed).19.2.0(2019-08-20)This is a GraalVM feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.1.x or older releases.Native ImageWe simplified the process of collecting data for profile-guided optimizations (PGO) for GraalVM Enterprise native images. PGO allows to optimize performance of native images by analyzing collected profiles during the image generation process. Since 19.2.0 you can collect data for PGO while running your application in a just-in-time (JIT) compiled mode:$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/java -Dgraal.PGOInstrument=myclass.iprof MyClass$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/native-image --pgo=myclass.iprof MyClass$ ./myclassPerformanceWe improved throughput for native image in GraalVM Enterprise when no profiles are available. Running the Micronaut GraalVM example shows spending ~10% less CPU time and achieving a ~10% higher throughput of requests per CPU second in 19.2.We also solved a common usability problem when a class marked forinitialization at runtime gets inadvertently initialized at build time. The flag -H:+TraceClassInitialization was introduced to help tracing what classes got initialized at runtime.JavaScript  We added support for date, time, timezone, instant and duration interoperabilitytypes to distinguish date-like objects from multiplelanguages in polyglot contexts (see changes to GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs).  Added Context.Builder.timeZone to set the time zone.  We implemented the Numeric separators TC39 proposal. It isavailable in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  We moved ICU data for internationalization APIs, e.g., date and time formatting, number formatting, collation for each individual supported language, previously distributed as separate files in &amp;lt;GRAALVM_HOME&amp;gt;/jre/languages/js/icu4j/icudt to the executable of JavaScript (js).More changes are listed in the JavaScript component changelog.LLVM InterpreterWe added preliminary support for compiling native programs to bitcode usingthe LLVM toolchain. The LLVM toolchain is a set of tools and APIs for compilingnative projects, such as C and C++, to bitcode that can be executed with theGraalVM LLVM runtime. It is aimed to simplify ahead-of-time compilation forusers and language implementers who want to use the GraalVM LLVM runtime. To doso, we provide launchers that invoke the C/C++ compiler with special flags toproduce results that can be executed by the GraalVM LLVM runtime. For moredetails, please consult the LLVM reference documentation.The toolchain is an experimental feature in this release.A complete list of changes to GraalVM LLVM runtime can be found in thechangelog.RubyA comprehensive list of changes to Ruby language component is available on GitHub. Major changes include:  Implemented support for Fiddle – an extension to translate a foreign function interface (FFI) and libffi wrapper for Ruby.  In terms of compatibility, Thread.report_on_exception is now true by defaultlike MRI 2.5+; BigDecimal compatibility has been generally improved in severalways.  Improved the performance by optimizing String methods to use the vectorinstructions when searching for a single-byte character in a String.  Fixed several bugs reported by community:          Set RbConfig::CONFIG[&#39;ruby_version&#39;] to the same value as the TruffleRuby version. This fixes reusing C extensions between different versions of TruffleRuby with Bundler (#1715).      Improved errors when interacting with single-threaded languages (#1709).      R  Added a new fastRCluster package that allows to run FastR inside GNU-R:          install in GNU-R or RStudio with: devtools::install_github(&#39;oracle/fastr/com.oracle.truffle.r.pkgs/fastRCluster&#39;);      use ?fastRCluster to learn more.        The problem that SET_ATTRIB does not validate the attributes as expected was resolved.The changelog is available on GitHub.PythonThe GraalVM Python implementation is still experimental and we are working towards improving completeness.  Implemented PyStructSequence_* C API – standard structured prediction functions.  Added support for more C API functions as PyEval_InitThreads and PyEval_ThreadsInitialized, type attributes i.e. nb_remainder, nb_subtract, overflowed and recursion_depth thread state fields.  Fixed printing of errors in the REPL and full paths in tracebacks.More details are available in the project changelog on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)We implemented the ability to configure custom polyglot access configuration withPolyglotAccess.newBuilder(). It allows to configure fine-grained accesscontrol for polyglot bindings and between polyglot languages. For example, givena TruffleObject as a value, there is a need to determine language and type ofthat object. This feature is significant for GraalVM execution inside OracleRDBMS.GraalVM 19.2.0 release also added support for date, time, timezone, durationvalues in polyglot APIs, and introduced the Context.Builder.timeZone(ZoneId)class to configure the default timezone of polyglot contexts.The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs changes between the versions are summarized in:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsA preview version of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) support has been released as a plugin for the VisualVM tool bundled with GraalVM 19.2.0. The plugin reads all JFR snapshots created from Java 7 and newer and presents the data in typical VisualVM views familiar for its users.To install the JFR support, download GraalVM 19.2.0 from graalvm.org/downloads, unzip it and run /bin/jvisualvm to start VisualVM.Use `Tools | Plugins | Available Plugins` to list all available plugins and install the VisualVM-JFR and VisualVM-JFR-Generic modules.The JFR snapshots can be opened using either the File | Load… action or by double-clicking the JFR Snapshots node and adding the snapshot into the JFR repository permanently.Please follow the documentation of your Java installation how to create JFR snapshots.JFR support is currently anexperimentalfeature. Some advanced features like analyzing JVM internals, showing eventstack traces or support for creating JFR snapshots from live processes are notavailable in the preview version and will be addressed incrementally in thefollowing releases.GraalVM Updater UtilityWe fixed an issue where GraalVM Enterprise would by default download the GraalVM Community components from GitHub. If you are using GraalVM Community – nothing changes, you can still install the components as before, and the gu will locate the necessary jar files on GitHub and correctly install them:gu install native-image ruby R pythonIf you are using GraalVM Enterprise, you can install R and llvm-toolchain components from GitHub, for example:gu install RThe other components are available from the OTN page, and can be installed from a manually downloaded file, for example to install native-image support run:gu -L install native-image-installable-svm-svmee-darwin-amd64-19.2.0.jarVersion CalendarYou can now refer to GraalVM version calendar to learn more about the GraalVM release model and prepare for upcoming releases.",

Fixed an issue of JDK 11  GraalVM build not being recognized by macOS /usr/libexec/java_home -V (#801).  Implemented a new C APIs used by JSON 2.3.0 (#1857).  Ensured that GraalVM Native Image does  not have references to native methods from java.lang.reflect.Proxy (#1971).  Ensured that all native methods of core classes would be substituted to prevent reflection configuration issues (#1848).  Fixed an issue leading to JavaFX applications misbehave with GraalArithmeticStubs (#1867).  Ensured that DynamicProxySupport classes being called from multiple threads are thread safe (#1927).  Prevent static field values changing during a native image generation (#1945).  Fixed the issue with the native linking step at image writing phase when the image uses functions from unsupported static JDK libraries (#1875).19.3.0.2(2019-12-24)This is a bugfix update including fixes to the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI) and necessary updates to the JDK 11 support.The following issues were addressed:  Approached the issue of DynamicProxySupport being not thread safe when DynamicProxySupport.addProxyClass is called from multiple threads (see #1927).  Resolved a problem leading to a wrong execution of the code produced with the GraalVM native-image builder at optimization level 2 -H:Optimize=2 (see #1995).  Fixed a problem when JavaFX applications misbehave with GraalArithmeticStubs (see #1867).  Resolved an issue of VM crashing when run with Serial GC (see #1892).  ReduceInitialCardMarks is unsafe with OptBulkAllocation in JDK 11 (see #1915).  Fixed a transient crash while building native images with GraalVM based on JDK11 (see #1906).19.3.0(2019-11-19)GraalVM 19.3 is the first planned Medium-Term Support (MTS) release built fromthe main line of the project. This is also a major feature release and it is arecommended upgrade to it. The MTS status assures that stability, security, andperformance fixes will be backported from the current branch for the next 18months.GraalVM JDK 11 Based BuildsWith the major update to the 19.3 version, we announce the first release ofGraalVM based on JDK 11! This represents a substantial milestone given thedifferences between JDK 8 and JDK 11. In particular, the Java Platform ModuleSystem (JPMS) introduced in JDK 9 means GraalVM now uses module encapsulation to isolate code such as JVMCI, the GraalVM compiler and the Truffle API from application code. In addition, it means GraalVM on JDK 11 includes all theJDK changes since JDK 8. These are detailed in the release notes for JDK 9,JDK 10and JDK 11.In terms of languages, GraalVM on JDK11 supports all JVM languages (Java, Scala etc.) aswell as all guest languages currently supported in GraalVM on JDK8.Due to the modular structure of the base JDK, there is no more $GRAALVM_HOME/jre/ directoryin the GraalVM package based on JDK 11. This has an impact on the path to the languages location,e.g., $GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/js now becomes $GRAALVM_HOME/languages/js):GraalVM Native Imageon JDK 11 allows usage of all JDK 8 command line options. Currently the nativeimage builder ($GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image) does not support the JavaPlatform Module System (JPMS) and has no module introspection at image run time.Pease note, at present GraalVM Updater cannot rebuild images ($GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu rebuild-images) with GraalVM Enterprise and Community editions on JDK 11. Even if GraalVM Native Image is installed, a user will encounter the following error while rebuilding:$ $GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu rebuild-images rubyError: rebuild-images utility is not available. You may need to install &quot;native-image&quot; component.Please refer to documentation for the details.A possible workaround is to rebuild images invoking rebuild-images command directly, e.g.:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/rebuild-images rubyPlease be informed, to have GraalVM JDK 11 based build on macOS listed by /usr/libexec/java_home -V you need to:  extract the GraalVM archive to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ location  mkdir /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-19.3.0/Contents/MacOS  cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-19.3.0/Contents/MacOS  ln -s ../Home/lib/jli/libjli.dylibThis issue will be fixed in the next release.GraalVM JDK 11 on ARM64We provide a preview of GraalVM Community Edition on JDK 11 for ARM64architecture. It includes the support for all JVM languages. The support for theother languages should follow soon after. This distribution includes GraalVMNative Image off the shelf to build instantly starting applications whichconsume less memory in ARM64 environments.There are some known limitations with this distribution at the moment:  npm and node do not support runtime code installation (Trufflecompilations). To avoid failing with java.lang.NullPointerException, disableTruffle compilations with npm --vm.Dgraal.TruffleCompilation=false or node--vm.Dgraal.TruffleCompilation=false.  npm and node crash with  a free(): invalid pointer error.Native ImageGraalVM 19.3 switched to using the JDK native code instead of manualsubstitutions. For GraalVM Native Image this switch to Java Native Interface(JNI) platform enabled the possibility to provide support for JDK 11 andextended support for Windows OS. It has no impact on startup time or memoryfootprint, and eliminates the need for shipping JDK libraries such aslibsunec.so along with native images that use Java crypto services. GraalVMnow ships with statically linkable version of the JDK libraries.Note that the sunec native library of SunEC provider gets statically linkedinto an image if required (see#951). Thus native images do notdepend on the sunec shared library anymore at runtime. However, if SunECprovider gets statically linked into an image on Linux and macOS the image willdepend on libstdc++.Native Image Maven PluginSupport for using GraalVM Native Image with Maven was introduced with theNative Image Maven Plugin. It means auser can build a project and its native image directly with Maven using the mvnpackage command. As of the GraalVM version 19.3, the Maven &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt; for theGraalVM Native Image related artifacts, including the plugin, changed fromcom.oracle.substratevm to org.graalvm.nativeimage:&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.nativeimage&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;native-image-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;19.3.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;native-image&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;package&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;skip&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/skip&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;            --no-fallback        &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;To use the plugin make sure GraalVM home is set as your JAVA_HOME environment and Native Image is installed. Using the plugin without GraalVM is not recommend.GraalVM Compiler  We have improved System.arraycopy to eliminate store checks when copying toObject[]. That improvement fixes slowdowns (versus C2) on some EclipseCollections benchmarks.  A performance regression when creating List values in Scala has been fixed bymore optimized inlining.  Fixed an issue that could prevent a method from being compiled that contains the JSR bytecode produced by older javac versions (see #1699).JavaScriptThe Node.js runtime available with GraalVM was updated to the 12.10.0 version, which brought some breaking changes.Additional proposals for ECMAScript 2020 have been implemented (Promise.allSettled and Nullish coalescing) and are available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).To provide better compatibility with the ECMAScript specification, some extensions are now disabled by default, some depending on the launcher (js, node, or via GraalVM Polyglot Context). This includes the print and printErr functions (the js.print flag), the global built-in (superseded by globalThis, use the js.global-property flag to reenable), or the performance global property (the js.performance flag).More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM InterpreterIn GraalVM 19.3 clang and other LLVM tools are no longer required to beinstalled for building the GraalVM LLVM runtime. The LLVM toolchain bundled with GraalVM is used.Also the LLVM toolchain is not an “experimental” feature any more and is used by other languages.For example, save this native code demonstrating the interoperability with Java as a polyglot.c file:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *arrayType = polyglot_java_type(&quot;int[]&quot;);    void *array = polyglot_new_instance(arrayType, 4);    polyglot_set_array_element(array, 2, 42);    int element = polyglot_as_i32(polyglot_get_array_element(array, 2));    printf(&quot;%dn&quot;, element);    return element;}Now you can compile it using GraalVM drop-in replacement of traditional clang:$GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/llvm/native/bin/clang polyglot.c -o polyglotThen run the executable (polyglot) with its dependencies encoded in GraalVM LLVM runtime:lli polyglotList of features that have also been added:  Preliminary support for parsing bitcode produced by LLVM 9  Added intrinsics for pthread thread management functions  Support for pthreads LLVM bitcodeRefer to the component changelog on GitHub.Python  Updated Python standard library to 3.7.4.  Implemented support for NumPy 1.16.4 and Pandas 0.25.0, that can be installed with:$ graalpython -m ginstall install numpy$ graalpython -m ginstall install pandas  With the help of Weblogic Scripting Team in conversion of Jython into GraalVM Python,added Jython compatibility (enabled with --python.EmulateJython) that allows importing ofJava classes and catching of Java exceptions in Python the same way Jython allows it.$ graalpython --jvm --experimental-option --python.EmulateJython&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import sun.misc.Signal&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.lang import Integer, NumberFormatException&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; try:...   Integer.parseInt(&quot;99&quot;, 8)... except NumberFormatException as e:...   pass  Added support for basic sockets. Note that SSL is not implemented, thus there is no https yet:import urllib.requestprint(urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;http://google.com&quot;).read())  Implemented missing functions and fixed bugs to run various modules (timeit, socket, pytest).  Improved performance of Java interoperability, exceptions that do not escape,various C API functions, and the parser. The parser is ~20% faster now, sometimes upto ~40%, the performance in micro benchmarks is 5x faster, micro benchmarks forC API are 5x faster, but there is no change to NumPy performance numbers.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  FastR has been updated to R version 3.6.1.  In this release, FastR does not ship with GCC runtime libraries. Use the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:          Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.04: apt-get install libgfortran3 libgomp1      Oracle Linux 7: yum install libgfortran libgomp      Oracle Linux 8: yum install compat-libgfortran-48      MacOS: brew install gcc@4.9        Preview of support for LLVM based execution of R native extensions.          FastR is configured to use the GraalVM LLVM toolchain to compile the C/C++ and Fortran code of R packages. The resulting binarieswill contain both the native code and the LLVM bitcode. The R packages that are shipped with FastR were also compiledusing the GraalVM LLVM toolchain and their binaries contain the LLVM bitcode.      FastR loads and runs the R extensions native code by default, but when run with the option --R.BackEnd=llvm,it will load and run the LLVM bitcode if available. You can use the LLVM backend selectively for specific R packages via --R.BackEndLLVM=pkg1,pkg2.      If you encounter any issues when installing R packages, you can switch back from the GraalVM LLVM toolchainto the native toolchain by running fastr.setToolchain(&quot;native&quot;) or by manually editing the $FASTR_HOME/etc/Makeconf file.        Fixed memory leaks reported on GitHub.  Fixed failures when working with large vectors (&amp;gt;1GB).  Implemented grepRaw, but only for fixed=T.We encourage the users to experiment with the new LLVM support and report anyissues to GitHub. To see thecomplete list of changes, please refer to the projectchangelog.RubyA comprehensive list of changes to the Ruby language component is available on GitHub.The focus has been on improving compatibility with Ruby on Rails applications.Major changes include:  Compilation of C extensions is now done with an internal LLVM toolchain producing both native code and bitcode. This means more C extensions should compile out of the box and this should resolve most linker-related issues.  It is no longer necessary to install LLVM for installing C extensions on TruffleRuby.  It is no longer necessary to install libc++ and libc++abi for installing C++ extensions on TruffleRuby.  On macOS, it is no longer necessary to install the system headers package (#1417).  License updated to EPL 2.0/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 like recent JRuby.  Installing sassc now works due to using the LLVM toolchain (#1753).  Include executables of default gems, needed for rails new in Rails 6.ToolsCode Coverage Command Line ToolAs of version 19.3 GraalVM provides a code coverage command line tool to recordand analyze the source code coverage of a particular execution of code forlanguages implemented with the Truffle framework. Enable it with --codecoverageoption, for example js --codecoverage. Visit the tool reference documentation for moreinformation.GraalVM VisualVM  Previously, to view the JFR files you had to install a plugin. Now GraalVM VisualVM contains the viewer in the tool core. Other JFR viewer improvements include new views for Exceptions and GC, improved performance and accuracy.  The tool is now able to monitor and profile AArch64 Java and Java 13 processes.Debugger  Enabled support for functional breakpoints and memory tools in Chrome Inspector.Visual Studio Code ExtensionsVSCode extensions are provided as VSIX packages. GraalVM team created the firstVSIX extension based on Python implementation. The extension installs with npmpackage manager and upon the extension installation, the user is requested topoint the PATH environment variable to GraalVM home directory.Changes for GraalVM Embedders (SDK)  Added new APIs for statement count resource limits:ResourceLimits.newBuilder()ResourceLimits.newBuilder()    .statementLimit(1000, null)    .build();              Duration.ofMillis(10))    .statementLimit(1000, null).build();try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .resourceLimits(limits).build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;while(true);&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    assert e.isCancelled();}  The default temporary directory can now be configured by FileSystem. A getTempDirectory()method of the FileSystem interface will return the default temporary directory.  Added the org.graalvm.home.Version version utility that allows to create, validate and compare GraalVM versions.  Added support for detecting and mapping polyglot exception values. Exceptions can be detected using Value.isException().  Added default target type mapping from guest language exceptions to PolyglotException.Proceed to the GraalVM SDK changelog for the complete list of changes.Changes for GraalVM Language or Tool Implementers (Truffle)  Added standard block node for language implementations. The block node usage allows the optimizingruntime to group elements of a block into multiple block compilation units. This optimization may beenabled using --engine.PartialBlockCompilation (on by default) and configuredusing --engine.PartialBlockCompilationSize (default 3000).  Merged new experimental inlining heuristic. Inlining budgets are now based on Graal IR nodecounts and no longer Truffle Node counts.  Support boolean literals in Truffle DSL expressions. Use true or false in expressions,e.g., isFunction(value) == false.  Added support for temporary files and directories.  Threads created by the embedder may now be collected by the GC before they canbe disposed. If languages hold onto thread objects exposed viainitializeThread they now need to do so with WeakReference. This avoidsleaking thread instances.  Added the new execute method to LoopNode, which allows loops to return values.To see the full list of changes to the APIs, proceed to theGraalVM Truffle changelog.",

Windows is no longer an experimental platform in the GraalVM ecosystem.Windows builds now contain the functional gu utility to install thecomponents. GraalVM Native Image component needs to be installedwith gu as on other platforms. JavaScript engine is now included in the GraalVM Windows distribution. Node.js support on the Windows platform is scheduled to be included in the next GraalVM release (20.1).GraalWasm, the WebAssembly component, is distributed through the usual component distribution channels.The GraalVM distribution for AArch64 now includes a functional node.js runtime (both in --jvm and native modes).Java  GraalVM Community Editions are based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_242 and OpenJDK version 11.0.6.  GraalVM Enterprise Editions are based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_241 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.6. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added mitigation of Jump Conditional Code (JCC) Erratum (see #1829).  GraalVM has a default setting of ThreadPriorityPolicy=1, which means thread priorities set in Java are reflected by native operating sytstem thread priorities. This may affect Java application performance.Native Image  Native Image support on Windows has significantly advanced. Please report issues if you find any problems.  Native images built with GraalVM Enterprise can now include a G1-based low-latency garbage collector that reduces stop-the-world pauses and improves latency. It is an experimental feature that can be enabled at image build time with -H:+UseLowLatencyGC. For more details, please refer to the documentation.  Fixed several Java Native Interface (JNI) and JDK11 related issues, please refer to GitHub for more information.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to 12.15.0, please see Node.js 12.15.0 release notes.  Added the js.commonjs-require option to load npm-compatible CommonJS modules from plain JavaScript. This is an experimental feature. See NodeJSVSJavaScriptContext.md for details.  Added the js.load-from-classpath option to allow loading files from the classpath via the classpath: pseudo URLs (disabled by default). Its usage is not recommended with untrusted code.  Added the implementation of the String.prototype.replaceAll proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  Updated String.prototype.matchAll to be available only in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  Added the js.bind-member-functions option for the implicit binding of unbound functions returned by Value.getMember to the receiver. The preferred way of calling members is using Value.invokeMember.  Made the support for Nashorn pseudo URLs available only in the Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat).  Implemented support for public and private class fields, including static fields. This feature can be enabled using the experimental option js.class-fields and is available by default in Node.js.  Added the js.global-arguments option with true as a default value for the non-standard arguments global property.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  The toolchain is now based on LLVM 9.0.0.  Support accessing llvm-ar, llvm-nm, llvm-objcopy, llvm-objdump, llvm-ranlib, llvm-readelf, llvm-readobj and llvm-strip via the toolchain.For more details refer to the component changelog on GitHub.Python  Improved Jython Compatibility by implementing syntax from JavaType import * to import all static members of a Java class, and by enabling import of Python code from inside JAR files by adding path/to/jarfile.jar!path/inside/jar to sys.path.  Added support for date and time interop.  Added support for setting the time zone via Context.Builder.timeZone.  Implemented PEP 570 - Python Positional-Only Parameters.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  On Linux, the required version of libgfortran changed from 3 to 5. See the requirements section for details.  Implemented subsetting an array by numeric and/or string matrix.  Fixed an issue where polyglot value is not an object (see #123).  Fixed an issue with the incorrect formatting for sprintf %g and %G (trailing zeroes, see #126).  Added  R builtins and C APIs:          Ported all external C functions used by nlm (see #100) and fisher.test from the stats base package.      Added Rf_asS4 C API function (see #118).      More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyA detailed changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub.  Updated to Ruby 2.6.5 (see #1749).  Updated the internal LLVM toolchain to LLVM 9 and reduce its download size.  Automatically set PKG_CONFIG_PATH as needed for compiling OpenSSL on macOS (see #1830).  Performance improvements related to sockets and RSTRING_PTR.  100+ compatibility and bug fixes, please refer to the changelog.Changes for GraalVM Embedders (SDK)  The deprecated graalvm.home and graalvm.version system properties have been removed, use the HomeFinder instead.  Added EventContext.createError which allows to introduce guest application errors in execution listeners/nodes.  Added Context.Builder.currentWorkingDirectory to set the current working directory used by the guest application to resolve relative paths.  The algorithm used to generate a unique URI for a Source built without an URI was changed to SHA-256.  All Truffle Graal runtime options (-Dgraal.) will be deprecated with 20.1. The Truffle runtime options are no longer specified as Graal options (-Dgraal.). The Graal options must be replaced by corresponding engine options specified using the polyglot API. The TRUFFLE_STRICT_OPTION_DEPRECATION environment variable can be used to detect usages of deprecated GraalVM options. When the TRUFFLE_STRICT_OPTION_DEPRECATION is set to true and the deprecated Graal option is used, the Truffle runtime throws an exception listing the used deprecated options and corresponding replacements.More details are in the SDK and Truffle changelogs.Tooling  Added an option for gu to install all available components from a local directory, for example: gu install -C /path/to/downloaded/20.0-components/ native-image llvm-toolchain ruby r python wasm.  Added a JDK Flight Recorder Data Viewer to VisualVM.  Added an integration of T-trace instrumentation framework with OpenTracing.  Added LLVM languages support to T-trace instrumentation framework  Added a Technology Preview of the Language Server Protocol implementation for GraalVM languages and its support to GraalVM VSCode Extensions.",

                    "content": "20.1.0(2020-05-19)Java  GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_252 and OpenJDK version 11.0.7.  Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_251 andOracle JDK version 11.0.7. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for theseversions at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added support for compiling classes with irreducible loops in the bytecode. Theseoften occur in Kotlin applications using coroutines with loops. The supportboth improves performance of such applications and enables their ahead-of-time compilation.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added new TuneInlinerExploration option to increase or decrease the time spentexploring inlining opportunities. Tuning this option helps to achieve betterpeak performance or limit time to reach (potentially lower) peak performancewhich might improve overall speed of the program. This option is only aheuristic and should be tuned for a specific application.  Added support to optimize away some redundant clone operations. For example, incode patterns similar to the one below, the GraalVM compiler will avoid creatingthe array clone:new int[length].clone().length      Added support for visualizing libgraal memory usage in VisualVM:    The mitigation of the Intel JumpConditional Code (JCC) Erratum is now only enabled for CPUs that need it.  Significantly improved performance for some benchmarks on JDK 11 due to fixes inthe area of synchronization. The most notable improvement isRenaissance:reactorswhich shows approximately 50% better results.Native Image  Improved scalability of the static analysis. The static analysis time wasinfeasible for some large applications. We added a new mechanism, called“saturated type flows”, to make the analysis faster. The new analysis isdisabled by default for GraalVM 20.1, but we plan to enable it by default in afuture release. We encourage all users to try it out using the image builderoption -H:+RemoveSaturatedTypeFlows. According to our measurements theprecision of the static analysis is comparable, but if you have an applicationwhere many more classes or methods are reachable with this option please create an issue on GitHub.  Added new option for the image generator to exit handlers on terminationsignals: --install-exit-handlers. This improves the user experience whenrunning a native image in a Docker container as the init process, since Linuxdoes not install a default signal handler for the process with id “1” and thenative image is therefore not reacting to a shutdown request from Docker.  Improved support for soft references. Before 20.1, soft references (the JavaSoftReference class) were cleared immediately at every GC like weakreferences. Now they are cleared based on a policy that takes the last accessand the memory pressure into account.  Added survivor spaces to the GC. Disabled by default until a proper policy isimplemented, see this GitHub issue for ideas and tasks aroundGC in native images.  Added generation of Dwarf debug information.  Improved support for timezones: information about all timezones is now includedin every image, and the default timezone is correctly initialized at imagestartup and no longer fixed at image generation time.  Improved checking that the native compiler toolchain is correct, for example,whether the compiler version on Windows is correct. This avoids strange errors dueto known incompatible compiler versions.Many more compatibility improvements and bug fixes can be found on GitHub. Forexample, here is a list of fixed issues relevant for Spring framework support.JavaScript  Enabled ECMAScript 2020 mode features by default.  Implemented several ECMAScript proposals, including Optional Chaining, HashbangGrammar, FinalizationRegistry, private class methods, RegExp Match Indices,export * as ns from &quot;mod&quot;, Intl.Locale, Intl.DisplayNames, Intl.DateTimeFormatdateStyle and timeStyle.  Added npx (npm package runner) utility into GraalVM distributions.  Removed the JOni RegExp-engine and the use-tregex option. TRegex engine is now the default regex engine.  Removed our SIMD.js implementation.LLVM Runtime  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added a preliminary support for running C++ code in managed mode.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Updated musl libc to version 1.1.24.  Both libc++ and libc++abi are now shipped as bitcode libraries.  Improved C++ support, libsulong++ is loaded only if libc++ is loaded. Theexecutables (ELF, Mach-O) compiled with the toolchain usually have a dependencyon this library and will continue to work. Plain bitcode files, which do notallow specification of dependencies, may fail with an error similar to thefollowing:    Global variable ZNSt3_15ctypeIcE2idE is declared but not defined.    This can be solved, for example, by specifying the dependency on the commandline lli --lib libc++.so.1 ... on Linux or lli --lib libc++.1.dylib onmacOS.    Changed module initialization order to be only based on the dependenciesrecorded in the ELF/Mach-O file (instead of looking at imported symbols). Thismight change the order in which plain bitcode files are initialized since theydo not allow recording dependencies. If the initialization order is important,the suggested approach is to use ELF/Mach-O files. See theToolchaindocumentation for more details.  Added support for on-stack-replacement of loops during bitcode execution, now itcan compile long-running loops before the surrounding function is compiled.Python  Updated to Python 3.8.2.  Improved tuples with primitive elements performance.  Improved performance of sequences, sets, dicts, and list expressions.  Added support of cProfile and trace modules through the GraalVM CPU sampler and coverage, respectively.  Added support of NumPy on macOS.  Added support of setuptools-scm and pytz.timezone.  Added support of a new syntax for iterable unpacking from yield and return statements.  Fixed issues with inspection and printing of non-Python numbers in the Chrome debugger.  Fixed issues with AST sharing across different contexts when these contexts run concurrently on multiple threads.  Fixed passing non-ASCII strings to gethostbyname.  Improved Jython compatibility mode: treat Java null as identical to Python None when comparing with the is operator.  Improved Jython compatibility mode: isinstance now works with Java classes and objects.  Moved all GraalPython specific functions on sys or builtins to the _graalpython_ module.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  Preview of improved graphical support based on the graphics, grDevices, and JavaGD packages          Use --R.UseInternalGridGraphics=false to activate this feature.      Our custom grid package re-implementation, which is currently the default, will be first deprecated and then removed in future releases.        Included GCC runtime libraries for supported systems (Linux and macOS)  Removed GFortran as a requirement to run FastR.  The GFortran runtime libraries versions are 4.8.5 on Linux and 8.3.0 on macOS. When compiling additional R packages with Fortran code, one must use GFortran of the same or higher version.          There’s a known issue: the libgomp.1.dylib library is not distributed with FastR on MacOS. To workaround this issue: install GCC with the package manager of your choice, e.g., brew install gcclocate file libgomp.1.dylib. Variable $GOMPLIB will denote full path to this library and $R_HOMEthe path to R installation:$GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/R on JDK8 based builds$GRAALVM_HOME/languages/R on JDK11 based buildsexecute these two commands:install_name_tool -change /cm/shared/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib/libgomp.1.dylib $GOMPLIB $R_HOME/lib/libRblas.dylibinstall_name_tool -change /cm/shared/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib/libgomp.1.dylib $GOMPLIB $R_HOME/lib/libRlapack.dylib        GFortran is now the default Fortran compiler even in the LLVM toolchain configuration.  Added support for traceback() to show frames from other GraalVM languages and C/C++ when run in the LLVM mode (--R.BackEnd=llvm).  Improved interoperability with other languages: “@” and “$” can be used to access members of foreign polyglot objects.A detailed list of the changes and bug fixes is available in the project changelog.Ruby  Added nightly builds, see the README for details.  ||= will not compile the right-hand-side if it is only executed once, to match the idiomatic lazy-initialization use-case (see the blog post).  Optimized performance of bundle install.  Added the --metrics-profile-require option to profile searching, parsing, translating and loading files.  Changed the C API type VALUE to be defined as unsigned long as on MRI. This enables using switch (VALUE) and other expressions which rely on VALUE being an integer type.  Removed deprecated Truffle::System.full_memory_barrier, Truffle::Primitive.logical_processors, and Truffle::AtomicReference.  Improved interoperability with other languages: hash keys are no longer reported as polyglot members.  Added Truffle::Interop.hash_keys_as_members to treat a Ruby Hash as a polyglot object with the Hash keys as members.Other 56 bug fixes and 52 compatibility improvements, see a detailed changelog.ToolingChrome Inspector  Implemented the display of asynchronous stack traces in debugger, in Chrome Inspector and in exception traces.Language Server Protocol  Improved stability of GraalVM Language Server and GraalVM VSCode Extensions.  Changed to start GraalVM Language Server in the native mode for better startup performance.  Stabilized support for LSP in R and Ruby.VisualVM  Enabled VisualVM to monitor libgraal memory usage.  Implemented showing compiled and interpreter time in the GraalVM sampler.  Improved JFR viewer to display stack traces for JFR events.Ideal Graph Visualizer      Added grouping of graph dumps by session:    Added an action to go to compiler classes.  Improved stability of IGV to no longer hang on some graph layout.GraalVM Updater gu  Added support for wildcards when GraalVM Updater installs from a directory (-C).Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Value.isMetaObject(), Value.getMetaQualifiedName(), Value.getMetaSimpleName() and Value.isMetaInstance(Object) to allow language agnostic access to meta-objects like classes or types.  The result of Value.getMetaObject() will always return meta-objects. It is recommended but not required to change uses of meta-objects to use Value.getMetaQualifiedName() instead of Value.toString() to return a type name.  Added OptionDescriptor.getDeprecationMessage returning the option deprecation reason. Added OptionDescriptor.Builder.deprecationMessage() to set the option deprecation reason.  Added Context.Builder.hostClassLoader to allow an embedder to specify a context ClassLoader for code execution.More changes can be found in the GraalVM SDK changelog.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  engine.Mode is now a supported option and no longer experimental.  Added new meta-data APIs to InteropLibrary:          has/getLanguage(Object receiver) to access the original language of an object      has/getSourceLocation(Object receiver) to access the source location of an object (e.g., a function or classes)      has/toDisplayString(Object receiver, boolean allowsSideEffect) to produce a human-readable string      has/getMetaObject(Object receiver) to access the meta-object of an object      isMetaObject(Object receiver) to find out whether an object is a meta-object (e.g., Java class)      getMetaQualifiedName(Object receiver) to get the qualified name of a meta-object      getMetaSimpleName(Object receiver) to get the simple name of a the meta-object      isMetaInstance(Object receiver, Object instance) to check whether an object is an instance of a meta-object        Added TruffleLanguage.getLanguageView that allows to wrap values to add language specific information for primitive and foreign values.  Added TruffleLanguage.getScopedView that allows to wrap values to add scoping and visibility to language values.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getScopedView and TruffleInstrument.Env.getLanguageView to access language and scoped views from instruments.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getLanguageInfo to convert language classes to LanguageInfo.  Added @GenerateLibrary(dynamicDispatchEnabled = false) that allows to disable dynamic dispatch semantics for a library. The default is true.  Added ability to load external default exports for libraries using a service provider. See GenerateLibrary(defaultExportLookupEnabled = true).  Added @ExportLibrary(transitionLimit=&quot;3&quot;) that allows the accepts condition of exported libraries to transition from true to false for a library created for a receiver instance. This is, for example, useful to export messages for array strategies.  Added support for asynchronous stack traces for languages and tools to allow debuggers to show them.To see a full list of changes to APIs, proceed to theGraalVM Truffle changelog.",

                    "content": "20.2.0(2020-08-18)Java  GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_262 and OpenJDK version 11.0.8.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_261 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.8.0.2. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for these versions at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added the ability to release the memory used by libgraal to the OS when an application enters a stable phase and compilation goes idle. This is achieved by attaching each compiler thread to a libgraal isolate. The number of compiler threads that can be attached to an isolate is controlled by the jvmci.ThreadsPerNativeLibraryRuntime system property. The default is all threads attached to a single isolate. Isolates are initialized on demand to handle extra compiler threads. When a compiler thread becomes idle (idleness delay is configurable by jvmci.CompilerIdleDelay), it detaches itself from its isolate. As the last thread detaches from an isolate, it is shutdown and its memory (i.e., the libgraal heap) is released to the OS. This feature has the following of advantages:          It can reduce the RSS memory footprint of a GraalVM process. If the compiler is not being used, it uses no resources.      [GraalVM Enterprise] If multiple isolates are used, it mitigates interference between complier threads. For example, there is less contention on shared objects and a garbage collection in one isolate will not pause threads in other isolates.        [GraalVM Enterprise] Improved the optimization responsible for removing redundant read/write, array clone() and accesses to the cloned arrays operations. Workloads that heavily use array read/write operations, especially inside loops, in combination with allocations may benefit from this optimization. As a result of the enhanced read/write optimization, the speedups of up to 2.5x on the JetStream benchmarks were seen with GraalVM JavaScript engine.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added an experimental partial loop unrolling optimization. Partial loop unrolling is an extended form of traditional loop unrolling optimization that works for arbitrary counted loops with an unknown upper bound of loop iterations i. The optimization is not enabled by default, you can experiment with the optimization by enabling it with -Dgraal.EnterprisePartialUnroll=true. Note, the optimization is still experimental and thus may lead to unknown errors.  Fixed an error in code generation which was leading to incorrect behaviour of programs using the Apache commons-compress BZip2 implementation (see #2534).  Improved excessive compile time of certain programs (see #2548).  Improved error reporting with libgraal. Fatal errors in libgraal now produce a hs-err crash log that can substantially improve triaging and debugging such errors. Likewise, low level libgraal output, such as libgraal GC messages produced by -Dlibgraal.PrintGC=true are routed to HotSpot’s log stream. That is, libgraal error handling and logging is unified with HotSpot support for these features and thus configurable by options such as -XX:LogFile and -XX:OnError.  Renamed the MitigateSpeculativeExecutionAttacks compiler option to SpectrePHTBarriers (e.g., use -Dgraal.SpectrePHTBarriers=AllTargets for java or --vm.Dgraal.SpectrePHTBarriers=AllTargets for js).Native Image  [GraalVM Enterprise] Improved the G1GC-like garbage collection for workloads where Native Image requires smaller GC pauses. More details are in the documentation on how to enable and configure it documentation on how to enable and configure it.  Improved generation of native images statically linked against muslc. If you have musl-gcc on the path, you can now generate a native image statically linked against muslc with the following options: --static --libc=musl. More information about this is available in the documentation.  Added an option to create “mostly static” native images which link statically everything except libc. Native images built this way are convenient to use in small docker images, for example, based on distroless/static. Enable nearly static native image generation with the following option: -H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC.  Enabled -H:+RemoveSaturatedTypeFlows by default, which should result in faster native image generation and use less memory for the generation.  Changed the class initialization strategy to initialize at build time only a small part of the JDK library. To get the previous behaviour back, use --initialize-at-build-time option for necessary packages.  Many other improvements and bug fixes can be found in the repository.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 12.18.0. Notable changes in this release are available from the Node.JS project website.  Updated ICU4J library to version 67.1.  Implemented the Intl.NumberFormat Unified API proposal.  Implemented the Logical Assignment Operators proposal.  Implemented the Top-level Await proposal.  Implemented the Promise.any proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2021 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2021).  Implemented support for async stack traces.  Fixed Date.toLocaleString and Intl.DateTimeFormat to use the context’s default time zone rather than the system default if no explicit time zone is requested.  Improved js.timezone option to validate the time zone ID and support zone offsets like “-07:00”.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  Enabled by default the new inlining heuristic in which inlining budgets are based on Graal IR node counts and not on Truffle Node counts. More information can be found in the Inlining guide.  Added support for subclassing DynamicObject so that guest languages can directly base their object class hierarchy on it, add fields and use @ExportLibrary on subclasses.  Added new DynamicObjectLibrary API for accessing and mutating properties and the shape of DynamicObject instances. More information can be found in the Dynamic Object Model guide.  Added new identity APIs to InteropLibrary:          hasIdentity(Object receiver) to find out whether an object specifies identity      isIdentical(Object receiver, Object other, InteropLibrary otherLib) to compare the identity of two object      isIdenticalOrUndefined(Object receiver, Object other) to specify the identity of an object      identityHashCode(Object receiver) to implement maps that depend on identity        Added Truffle DSL @Bind annotation to common out expression for use in guards and specialization methods.  Added the ability to disable adoption for DSL cached expressions with type node using @Cached(value =&quot;...&quot;, weak = true).  Added an option not to adopt the parameter annotated by @Cached, using @Cached(value =&quot;...&quot;, adopt = false).  Added CompilerDirectives.shouldNotReachHere() as a short-cut for languages to indicate that a path should not be reachable neither in compiled nor interpreted code paths.More details are available from the changelog.Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Context.parse(Source) to parse but not evaluate a source. Parsing the source allows to trigger e.g., syntax validation prior to executing the code.  Added PolyglotException.isResourceExhausted() to determine if an error was caused by a resource limit (e.g., OutOfMemoryError) that was exceeded.  Added a factory method creating a FileSystem based on the host Java NIO. The obtained instance can be used as a delegate in a decorating filesystem.  Added optional FileSystem.isSameFile method testing if the given paths refer to the same physical file. The method can be overridden by the FileSystem implementer with a more efficient test.More details are available from the changelog.ToolingVS Code  Updated Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation to support the latest protocol version 3.15.  Updated VSCode extension by merging into one. More details about Visual Studio Code Extension.  Added showing code coverage from GraalVM LSP in VS Code.VisualVM  Updated VisualVM to use NetBeans platform 11.3.  Added GoToSource from VisualVM to your preferred IDE.Ideal Graph Visualizer[GraalVM Enterprise]  Implemented usability improvements for graphs identification in IGV (IGV graph now displays a dump ID and a user label with Graph name).  Added Go To Type and Attach Debugger actions.  IGV updated to NetBeans platform to 11.3.LLVM Runtime  Added support for InteropLibrary.isIdentical and related messages.  Added the --print-toolchain-api-identifier, --print-toolchain-api-tool &amp;lt;tool-name&amp;gt; and --print-toolchain-api-paths &amp;lt;path-name&amp;gt; arguments to the lli launcher. These can be used to query the Toolchain API from the command line.  Added support for requesting locations via the #getPaths() method to the Java API of the Toolchain. For example, the location of the toolchain executables or libraries.  Added llvm/api/toolchain.h header for accessing the Toolchain from C code.  Added ability to read and write bigger values to a polyglot i8 array. For example, when reading an i64 from a foreign value that is typed as i8 array, the LLVM runtime will read 8 i8 values and combine them to an i64 result.  Removed the --llvm.sourcePath option (deprecated since 19.0). Use --inspect.SourcePath instead.  Removed support for the application/x-llvm-ir-bitcode-base64 mime-type (deprecated since 19.0).Python  Improved reference counting for native extensions to prevent memory leaks.  Added code serialization to .pyc files (.pyc files persistently store the Python bytecode compiled from the source .py files).  Fixed warning in pandas about size of the datetime objects.  Improved compatibility (more CPython unittests pass for core types).  Added support for parsing requests with arguments for embedding Python.  Added support for the basic usage of tox – a Python testing wrapper.  Removed support for iterables as arrays in polyglot applications.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added a faster implementation of _struct.R  Improved SVG support activated with the --R.UseInternalGridGraphics=false flag.  Improved FastR user experience: FastR should have no requirements on both Linux and macOS i.e., installing GCC or GFortran should not be necessary to run FastR, but it may be necessary to install some third party R packages.RubyNew features:  Updated to Ruby 2.6.6.  Configured Ruby to always show core library files in backtraces.  The Java stacktrace is now shown when sending SIGQUIT to the process, also on TruffleRuby Native, see Debugging for details.  Use InteropLibrary#toDisplayString() to better display objects from other languages.  foreign_object.to_s now uses InteropLibrary#toDisplayString() (and still asString() if isString()).  foreign_object.inspect has been improved to be more useful (include the language and meta object).  foreign_object.name = value will now call Interoplibrary#writeMember(&quot;name&quot;, value) instead of invokeMember(&quot;name=&quot;, value).  Calls to foreign objects with a block argument will now pass the block as the last argument.  foreign.name will now use invokeMember if invocable and if not use readMember. See doc/contrib/interop_implicit_api.md for details.Bug fixes:  Fix #class_exec, #module_exec, #instance_eval, and instance_exec to use activated refinements (@ssnickolay).  Use upgraded default gems when installed.  The output for --engine.TraceCompilation is now significantly easier to read, by having shorter method names and source names.  Fixed indentation for squiggly heredoc syntax with single quotes.  Fixed missing flushing when printing an exception at top-level with a custom backtrace, which caused no output to be shown.Compatibility:  Implemented Ripper by using the C extension.  Implemented ObjectSpace::WeakMap.  Supported #refine for Module (@ssnickolay).  Fixed refine + super compatibility (@ssnickolay)  Implemented UnboundMethod#bind_call.  RUBY_REVISION is now the full commit hash used to build TruffleRuby, similar to MRI 2.7+.  Changed the lookup methods to achieve Refinements specification (@ssnickolay)Performance:  Enabled lazy translation from the parser AST to the Truffle AST for user code by default. This should improve application startup time.  instance variable ... not initialized and similar warnings are now optimized to have no peak performance impact if they are not printed (depends on $VERBOSE).  Implemented integer modular exponentiation using BigInteger#mod_pow ( @skateman).  Fixed a performance issue when computing many substrings of a given non-leaf String with non-US-ASCII characters.  Speedup native handle to Ruby object lookup for C extensions.Changes:  RubyGems gem commands updated to use the --no-document option by default.",

[GraalVM Enterprise] Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition isbased on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_271 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.9. You canfind Oracle JDK release notes for these versions at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Improved eliminating or delaying class loading from libgraal until after itsinitialization. This improves performance on workloads with very shortiterations (in milliseconds). It also fixes problems related to VM assumptionsabout the JIT compiler not loading classes, which could lead to races andsometimes deadlocks.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Improved conditional moveoptimization: GraalVM Enterprise contains an optimization that uses the CPU’sconditional move (CMOV) instruction to implement certain conditionalstatements. In this release we have improved this optimization to give higherand more predictable performance for workloads sensitive to conditional moveinstructions.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Improved heuristics in GraalVMEnterprise for loop peeling optimization for workloads where the first iterationinitializes array objects lazily. This is a common pattern in GraalVM’s Pythonruntime of Python iterators. It results in performance improvements for microPython benchmarks of up to 40%.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Improved code generated by GraalVMEnterprise for initializing newly allocated arrays, fixing a performance issuewhere large array allocations were initialized twice.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Improved the heuristics for the codeduplication optimization in GraalVM Enterprise which gives a peak performanceimprovement of up to 17% on some LLVM workloads and a 5% increase on some Javaworkloads.Native image  Improved container awareness: on Linux, the resource limits - processor count,memory size -  are read from cgroup V1 and V2 configurations. The processorcount can also be overridden on the command line using the option-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=.  Improved the “isolated compilation” that separates applications and theruntime compiler from each other, which improves performance by reducinginterference between them, for example, due to garbage collection.  [GraalVM Enterprise] The G1 garbage collector now also supportsnative images that use runtime-compiled code. It can be enabled at image buildtime using the option --gc=G1. G1 support is currently limited to Linux onAMD64. Windows and macOS support will be available in future releases. G1 nowalso supports performance counters (when the image is built with-H:+AllowVMInspection).  Improved the options to enable and disable assertions which now support the fullsyntax to specify package and class names. Assertions need to be configured atimage build time, using the options -ea / -da / -esa / -dsa. Thedefinition of “system assertions” is expanded to not only include assertions inthe JDK, but also in the Native Image runtime system, for example, in the garbagecollector implementation.  Added basic debug information generation on Windows (developed in collaboration with Red Hat).  Added many small performance and memory footprint optimizations. In particular,a new implementation of type checks improves the performance ofClass.isInstance and Class.isAssignableFrom with less type data in the imageheap.  Added support for method handles that represent a call to a single methodaccessible by the Reflection API, with no transformations applied through theMethod Handles API, such as calls to MethodHandle.bindTo() orMethodHandle.asType(). To enable this feature use--report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime.  Many other bug fixes and improvements which can be found in the GitHub repository.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  Enabled by default the elastic allocation of the compiler threads dependingon the number of available processors, in both JVM and native modes. The oldbehaviour, 1 or 2 compiler threads, can be explicitly enabled with--engine.CompilerThreads=0.  Added ThreadsActivationListener to listen to the thread enter and leave events in instruments.  Added new flags to inspect the expansion during partial evaluation:--engine.TraceMethodExpansion=truffleTier,--engine.TraceNodeExpansion=truffleTier,--engine.MethodExpansionStatistics=truffleTier and--engine.NodeExpansionStatistics=truffleTier. Language implementations areencouraged to run with these flags enabled and investigate their output forunexpected results. See Optimizing.md for details.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getOptions(TruffleContext) to retrieve contextspecific options for an instrument and TruffleInstrument.getContextOptions()to describe them. This is useful if an instrument wants to be configured percontext.  Added the ability to create context and context thread locals in languages and instruments. See ContextLocal and ContextThreadLocal classes for details.  Added NodeLibrary, which provides guest language information associated with aparticular Node location, the local scope mainly and TruffleLanguage.getScopeand TruffleInstrument.Env.getScope, which provides a top scope object of a guestlanguage.  Added ByteArraySupport: a helper class providing safe multi-byte primitive type accesses from byte arrays.  Added a new base class for the exceptions, see AbstractTruffleException. The original TruffleException has been deprecated. Added new interop messages for exception handling replacing the deprecated TruffleException methods.  Added new specialization utility to print detailed statistics about specialization instances and execution count. See Specialization Statistics for details on how to use it.  More details are available from the changelog.Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Context.interrupt(Duration) to interrupt a polyglot Context execution. The interrupt is non-destructive meaning that the polyglot Context can still be used for further execution.  Added the ability to specify a TargetMappingPrecedence of target type mappings for HostAccess configurations that influence conversion order and precedence in relation to default mappings and other target type mappings.  Added a log.file option that allows redirection of all languages, instrument or engine logging to a file. The handler configured with the Context.Builder.logHandler method has precedence over the new option.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added experimental sandbox resource limits for languages implemented on top of the Truffle language implementation framework.  More details are available from the changelog.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 12.18.4.  Fixed field/getter/setter access order in a Nashorn compatibility mode, see #343.  Fixed “Multiple applicable overloads found” error in a Nashorn compatibility mode, see #286.  Enabled low precedence lossy number, string-to-boolean, and number-to-boolean conversions in a Nashorn compatibility mode.  Fixed Java.extend to respect HostAccess.Builder.allowImplementations, see #294.  Added Java host interoperability support for mapping JavaScript objects to abstract classes (if HostAccess allows it).  Added js.foreign-object-prototype as a supported option to set JavaScript prototypes for foreign objects mimicing JavaScript types. It was renamed from js.experimental-foreign-object-prototype.  Changed ToPrimitive abstract operation to follow the specification for foreign objects. InteropLibrary.toDisplayString is not used by ToPrimitive/ToString conversions anymore.Ruby  Added handling foreign null object as falsy value (#1902).  Improve reliability of the post install hook by disabling RubyGems (#2075).  Fixed the top level exception handler to print exception cause (#2013).  Fixed handling of post arguments for super() (#2111).  Fixed constant/identifier detection in lexer for non-ASCII encodings (#2079, #2102).  Fixed parsing of --jvm as an application argument (#2108).  Added checking bounds for FFI::Pointer accesses when the size of the memory behind is known.  Implemented negative line numbers for eval (#1482).  Migrated from JLine 2 to JLine 3 for the readline standard library.  Added various warmup improvements, notably much less splitting and more operations are done inline, without a call.  Improved setting and access to the special variables $~ and $_ which has been refactored to require less splitting.  More details are available from the changelog.R  Improved compatibility with a preliminary implementation of the ALTREP framework: http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/talks/uiowa-2018.pdf  Exposed native function match5, which is necessary for R package fastmatch.  Added a few more smaller compatibility fixes and implemented missing APIs.  More details are available from the changelog.Python  Updated Python to version 3.8.5.  Added the experimental new HPy native API, so it is possible run piconumpy through HPy now.  The standalone graalpython version can now be installed through pyenv.  Many fixes to pass the unittests of standard library types and modules:complex, bytes, bytearray, subclassing of special descriptors, type layouts, float, generators, modules, argument passing corner cases, string literals and encodings, import and importlib, decimal, glob, the builtin module, json, math, operator, numeric tower, sys, warnings, random, f-strings, struct, itertools, super.LLVM runtime  Added support for code sharing in the GraalVM LLVM runtime. This allows the AST and compiled code of common bitcode libraries to be shared between multiple contexts within a single engine improving performance.  Updated LLVM toolchain to version 10.0.0.  Improved for va_list / varargs handling across language boundaries. Using va_start in an LLVM function that was called from a foreign language no longer forces all arguments into native memory. The resulting va_list object can be passed to code written in other languages, and accessed there using standard interop APIs.  Introduced the Handles API for storing managed pointers in native memory.  Moved polyglot.h to graalvm/llvm/polyglot.h and llvm/api/toolchain.h to graalvm/llvm/toolchain-api.h. The old header locations are deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.  Renamed libpolyglot-mock.so to libgraalvm-llvm.so. The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.ToolingVisual Studio Code Extensions  Enhanced a VSCode GraalVM Extension with:          Java syntax highlighting      Java code completion      Installation wizard to download and install GraalVM Community or GraalVM Enterprise from the UI      Integrated Java debugger with all the features you would expect from a full featured IDE debugger like the Netbeans IDE      Integrated Polyglot debugger allowing to debug Javascript, Python, R, Ruby and other GraalVM languages        Implemented a VS Code Micronaut extension which:          Leverages all the great features of the Graal VS Code Extension for Java      Includes a Micronaut project wizard for creating new Micronaut applications      Includes Gradle and Maven support      Includes support to easily create a native executable from a Micronaut Gradle application using GraalVM Native Image      GraalVM Dashboard  Re-implemented GraalVM Dashboard with OracleJET.

                    "content": "21.0.0.2(2021-02-11)This is a bug fix release for the GraalVM 21.0.x branch.It contains operational changes to GraalVM Updater - a tool for installing optional GraalVM language runtimes and utilities, and for updating your local GraalVM installation.  Enhanced the upgrading policies to prevent components not being upgraded when migrating from GraalVM Community to GraalVM Enterprise Edition (gu upgrade --edition ee).  Improved handling the license acceptance by gu when a user is prompted to accept “Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition Native Image License”.21.0.0(2021-01-19)JavaUpdated the underlying JDK GraalVM is built on:  GraalVM Community Edition is based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_282 and OpenJDK version 11.0.10.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_281 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.10. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for these versions at Oracle Java SE Downloads.Java on Truffle  Added an experimental Java Virtual Machine implementation based on a Truffle interpreter. Read more here.Container ImagesGraalVM Community images for Docker containers changed the location and now are available from GitHub Container Registry. See the guide.Platforms SupportAs of this version, we provide GraalVM distributions for Linux on ARM 64-bit system.All components including the GraalVM core are experimental.GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK11 for AArch64, and GraalVM Community Edition on OpenJDK 11 for AArch64 architecture accordingly.Native Image  Added serialization support for Native Image. The serialization support ensures constructors for classes are contained in a native image, so that they can be deserialized in the first place. These classes should be whitelisted in an additional specific configuration file, similar to the Reflection continuation, as some classes cannot be deserialized, including classes that might be part of the native image, but not listed in the configuration file. You can either create a configuration file manually or apply a Tracing Agent, provided with GraalVM, to help writing the configuration files.  Added method handle invocation support for Native Image (see #2761). Methods and fields accessed through method handles have to be registered in the Reflection configuration file. Also added method handles support to the Tracing agent to automatically generate the configuration for the native image build. Most use cases of method handles are supported. VarHandles that are not stored in static fields are still not supported.  Added AWT and Swing support for the Linux platform (configuration collection with the Tracing agent is necessary).  Added the experimental -H:+InlineBeforeAnalysis option to reduce the number of required configuration entries and lessen the image size.  Improved the Tracing agent: it now captures instances of Class.getClasses and Class.getDeclaredClasses.  Improved the ServiceLoaderFeature class to scan for services declared using modules.  Disallowed the instances of Random in the native image heap.  Improved GC performance (less time spent in GC).Updates for Language and Tool Implementers Using Truffle API  Fixed many issues related to multi-tier compilation. Multi-tier compilation (--engine.MultiTier) will be enabled by default in 21.1.  Added HostCompilerDirectives for directives that guide the host compilations of the Truffle interpreters:  HostCompilerDirectives.BytecodeInterpreterSwitchto denote methods that contain the instruction-dispatch switch in bytecode interpreters  HostCompilerDirectives.BytecodeInterpreterSwitchBoundary to denote methods that do not need to be inlined into the bytecode interpreter switch  Truffle DSL generated nodes are no longer limited to 64 state bits. Use these state bits responsibly.  More changes are listed in the changelog.Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added support for explicitly selecting a host method overload using the signature in the form of comma-separated fully qualified parameter type names enclosed by parentheses (e.g., methodName(f.q.TypeName,java.lang.String,int,int[])).  Deprecated the host method selection by JNI mangled signature, replaced by the aforementioned new form. Scheduled for removal in 21.2.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 12.20.1.  Enabled the following ECMAScript 2021 mode/features by default:          Class fields      Promise.any      String.prototype.replaceAll      Logical Assignment Operators        Adopted a new interop exception handling and made JS exceptions extend the AbstractTruffleException class.  Exposed Graal.versionECMAScript instead of Graal.versionJS.  Implemented the relative indexing method proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2022 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2022).Python  Added the jarray module for compatiblity with Jython.  Improved the support for Pandas and added the initial support for the Matplotlib visualization library.  Provided fixes to avoid possible memory leaks and crashes when running NumPy in a shared engine.  Fixed an infinite continuation prompt in REPL when pasting snippets.More details can be found in the changelog.Ruby  The new IRB is quite slow when copy/paste code into it. This is due to an inefficient io/console implementation which will be addressed in the next release. A workaround is to use irb --readline, which disables some IRB features but is much faster for copy/pasting code.New features:  Updated to Ruby 2.7.2. Most Ruby 2.7 features and changes are implemented (see #2004).Bug fixes:  Fixed setting of special variables in enumerators and enumerables (issue #1484).  Fixed issue with Method#to_proc and special variable storage (issue #2156).Compatibility:  **kwargs now accept non-Symbol keys like Ruby 2.7.Performance:  Refactor and implement more performant MatchData#length (see #2147).  Refactor and implement more performant Array#sample (see #2148).  String#inspect is now more efficient.Changes:  All InteropLibrary messages are now exposed consistently as methods on Truffle::Interop (see #2139). Some methods were renamed to match the scheme described in the documentation.  More details are available from the changelog.R  Fixed AssertionError when trying to install the R validate package (issue #169).LLVM runtime  Improved the AST sharing, and support for the auxiliary engine caching. On top of the regular AST sharing that allows sharing code between multiple contexts in a single engine, this allows persisting of shared code across process boundaries.  Added support for the current major release of macOS (macOS Big Sur).Deprecations:  Added a deprecation warning for the old header files locations polyglot.h and llvm/api/toolchain.h. These header files have been already deprecated in 20.3.0, but without a warning.GraalWasm  This release included a large number of bugfixes in semantics, linking and in-module validation. GraalVM’s WebAssembly interpreter now passes almost all tests from the official specification test suite.  Exposed Polyglot bindings that are needed for the JS-to-WebAssembly Interface API.  Optimized the GraalWasm interpreter, leading to warmup and an overall 20x peak performance improvement of the interpreted execution mode.  Improved the security by using the byte-buffer-based memory instead of the off-heap memory.ToolingGraalVM UpdaterStarting from version 21.0, GraalVM Updater has become more powerful and can be used to update your GraalVM local installation to a newer version or upgrade from a Community to Enterprise Edition. Read more in Upgrade GraalVM.Visual Studio Code Extensions  Added refactoring and other productivity features.  Published GraalVM 21.0 Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code on VS Code Marketplace. Read more on the advancements and modifications here.GraalVM Dashboard  Improved the BGV format to support large amount of integer properties.VisualVM  Enabled a seamless import of settings from the previous installations of VisualVM.",

                    "content": "21.1.0(2021-04-20)Java UpdatesThe OpenJDK release that GraalVM Community Edition is built on was updated to:  8u292 for Java 8 based GraalVM Community  11.0.11 for Java 11 based GraalVM Community  16.0.1 for Java 16 based GraalVM CommunityThe Oracle JDK release that GraalVM Enterprise Edition is built on was updated to:  8u291 for Java 8 based GraalVM Enterprise, please see Java SE 8 release notes  11.0.11 for Java 11 based GraalVM Enterprise, please see Java SE 11 release notes  16.0.1 for Java 16 based GraalVM Enterprise, please see Java SE 16 release notesPlatform Updates  Java 16 (experimental) support: The GraalVM distributions based on Oracle Java 16 and OpenJDK 16 are available for download with several known limitations.  MacOS platform support: Builds of GraalVM Community Edition for macOS based on OpenJDK 8 are no longer being produced. GraalVM Enterprise Edition for macOS  based on Oracle JDK 8 continue to be available.  Linux AArch64 platform compatibility: The GraalVM distributions for Linux AArch64 architecture remain experimental in this release. Supported features include the GraalVM compiler, the gu tool, the Node.js JavaScript runtime, Native Image, some developer tools.  Windows platform compatibility: To run GraalVM Community Edition based on OpenJDK 8u292 on a Windows platform, the MSVCR100.dll redistributable package needs to be installed (for more details, see the issue #3187).Compiler  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added support to detect inverted (tail counted) loops as counted loops. GraalVM Enterprise now detects such loops as counted, enabling them to be analyzed and optimized like all other counted loops. These loops are subject to full unrolling, partial unrolling, guard optimization and vectorization. This new capability can be disabled with -Dgraal.DetectInvertedLoopsAsCounted=false.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added a novel loop inversion optimization in GraalVM Enterprise. This adds compiler support to generate inverted loops from regular ones. Inverted loops have superior characteristics for instruction level parallelism and optimization capabilities compared to regular, head counted loops. We have seem performance improvements of up to 30% for micro benchmarks exercising the inverted loop shape. Loop inversion is on by default and can be disabled with -Dgraal.LoopInversion=false.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added a new optimization that analyzes code guarded by a conditional of the form x == y and replace all uses of x with y (or vice versa) if the replacement results in potential for further optimization.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Enhanced SIMD vectorization, to support vector byte reversal (e.g., Integer.reverseBytes). SIMD vectorization is still experimental and not enabled by default. Enable it with -Dgraal.VectorizeSIMD=true.  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added support for vectorizing hashCode-like loops using the hash = c * hash + array[i]. Disable with -Dgraal.VectorizeHashes=false.  Eliminated the cast of the loaded array element to Node, to prevent the situation when volatile fields are loading from arrays, losing type information about the element, and resulting in unneeded casts. This method in ConcurrentHashMap can be an example:     static final &amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt; Node&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt; tabAt(Node&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt;[] tab, int i) {      return (Node&amp;lt;K,V&amp;gt;)U.getObjectVolatile(tab, ((long)i &amp;lt;&amp;lt; ASHIFT) + ABASE);  }    Eliminate unneeded memory barriers on sequential volatile writes on x86. There are patterns in classes such as ConcurrentHashMap where numerous volatile writes can occur in a sequence (after inlining). The GraalVM compiler now omits the memory barrier for all but the last write in the sequence, speeding up methods such as ConcurrentHashMap.transfer.Native Image  Improved support for localization. Now you can specify which locales should be included in the native executable, and which should be the default. Forexample, to switch the default locale to German and also include French and English, use -H:DefaultLocale=de -H:IncludeLocales=fr,en. All locales can be included via -H:+IncludeAllLocales.  Deprecated the --enable-all-security-services option as it is no longer necessary. Security services are now registered automatically when found in use by static analysis.  Improved support on Windows: applications now do file globbing on parameters.  Added reporting on the native image build to produce multiple artifacts. Results of the build are written to the imagename.build_artifacts.txt file.  Fixed a bug on Linux and macOS that resulted in local symbols about all methods being included in the native image, when -g is passed for debug information generation. Method symbols are not necessary for debugging because the Dwarf debugging information also contains this information. When local symbols are desired, e.g., for certain profilers, they can be included in the image using -H:-DeleteLocalSymbols (independently of the -g option).  Allowed multiple different native images in the same process, e.g., an application and a shared library. This was required for Linux platforms.  Automatically mark more classes for build-time initializaiton. This reduces the overhead of class initialization at run time.Polyglot Runtime  Enabled multi-tier compilation by default. This feature was first introduced in 20.3 as an experimental option. Truffle now uses two tiers of compilation. The first tier is optimized for compilation speed and reuses the GraalVM compiler economy configuration to perform speedy compilations with method inlining of trivial methods only. The second tier compiles with all GraalVM’s compiler optimizations enabled and is performed after the first tier compilation is completed. Our benchmark results show that this improves warmup for most languages significantly.  Added new capabilities for language implementations that require an optional dependency to the newest JVMCI version 21.1-b02 (issue JDK-8263776). In the next release, 21.2 we plan to use some of these capabilities for core runtime functionality, and therefore JVMCI 21.1-b02 will become a required dependency. This will make runtime compilation for JDK releases that do not support JVMCI 21.1-b02 unsupported. Note that all Truffle languages can still be executed on any JDK but without support for runtime compilation.   Introduced new experimental flags to set the compilation thresholds for multi-tier compilation: --engine.FirstTierCompilationThreshold sets the threshold for the first, and --engine.LastTierCompilationThreshold for the second tier. If multi-tier compilation is disabled, --engine.SingleTierCompilationThreshold=x may be used. The original option, --engine.CompilationThreshold, is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Added a new experimental compilation queue implementation inspired by HotSpot. The implementation is not yet enabled by default, but can be tried out using the --engine.TraversingCompilationQueue option. The flag is expected to reduce warmup time. More changes and enhancements are planned for the next release, where it is expected to become the default implementation.  Deprecated the --engine.CompilationThreshold option. Use --engine.FirstTierCompilationThreshold and --engine.LastTierCompilationThreshold instead.Java on Truffle  Introduced many fixes and improvements to the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) support. Many edge cases have been fixed which increased the performance of Java on Truffle while debugging is enabled (up to 200x!).  Provided fixes for method redefinition: reflective access and MethodHandles now follow method changes.  Added support for signal handlers (sun.misc.Signal / jdk.internal.misc.Signal). This means shutdown hooks are now run when closing a program with Ctrl-C.  Removed the dependency on deprecated Scope API and implement newly introduced NodeLibrary instead.  Fixed guest stack traces as reported by the GraalVM embedder API (PolyglotException).  Improved support for restricting thread creation.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 14.16.1.  Node.js support is not enabled by default and must be installed explicitly with GraalVM Updater if needed: gu install nodejs. The JavaScript runtime continue to be included in the base GraalVM installation.  Added Iterator interoperability support. It allows JavaScript iterators to be used via the Value API (hasIterator(), getIterator(), hasIteratorNextElement(), getIteratorNextElement()), as well as iterable objects from other languages to be iterated in GraalVM’s JavaScript runtime (e.g., via for-of loops), and vice versa.  Enabled buffer interoperability support. It allows host ByteBuffers and buffers from other languages to be used with JavaScript typed arrays (e.g., new Uint8Array(foreignBuffer)) and DataView, without copying. It also enables access to ArrayBuffers via the Value API (readBuffer*, writeBuffer*).  Implemented the experimental version of the WebAssembly JavaScript Interface, which allows invoking WebAssembly programs from within JavaScript programs (available behind the --js.webassembly option).The changelog is available in the project repository.LLVM Runtime (Sulong)  [GraalVM Enterprise] The ability to build GraalVM or a native image with “native mode” completely removed (so only --llvm.managed mode works).  Made pointers to foreign “buffer-like” objects (e.g., JS ArrayBuffer) be transparently accessed like native buffers.  Added support for loading bitcode modules with regular dlopen in addition to the Polyglot API.   Added experimental support for the Linux AArch64 platform.  Implemented a sanity check to verify that loaded bitcode files are compiled correctly for the GraalVM LLVM Runtime. In particular, this will fail when loading bitcode that is built for managed mode and used in native mode, or vice versa. This can be turned into a non-fatal warning with the --llvm.verifyBitcode=false option.The project changelog is available on GitHub.Ruby  Implemented more complete support of Ruby 2.7 (see #2004 for more details).  Multi-tier compilation is now enabled by default, which improves warmup significantly.  C extensions which link to a static library now generally work by prepending the GraalVM LLVM toolchain to PATH when installing gems.  Improved the performance of checks for recursion (#2189).  Improved random number generation performance by avoiding synchronization (#2190).  Implemented the ability to create a single call target per block by default instead of two.  Optimized some uses of class variables (#2259).  Speeded up the interpreter and reduced footprint by making several methods that need the caller frame  always inlined in their caller.  Added support for accessing local variables of the interactive Binding via language bindings: context.getBindings(&quot;ruby&quot;).putMember(&quot;my_var&quot;, 42);. See #2030.  Made signal handlers run without triggering multi-threading.  Implemented the Debug Inspector C API.  Switched to the io-console C extension for better performance and compatibility in irb.  Updated to irb 1.3.3 and reline 0.2.3 which allow pasting code in IRB reasonably fast (#2233).  Standalone builds of TruffleRuby are now based on JDK11 (they used JDK8 previously).More details are available from the TruffleRuby changelog.Python  Improved support for Java subclassing and  new Interoperability APIs for better Jython migration path. The features often requested and available with Jython, like convenient iteration over Python types from Java, implementing Java abstract classes and interfaces from Python, catching and re-throwing Java exceptions in Python code, are now provided with GraalVM’s Python runtime as well, making the migration easier.  Added the SSL support. This allows out-of-the-box installation of Python packages. Now users can run the Python pip installer to download Python packages, and their dependencies, just as they would on CPython.  Added a completely native backend for posix API. This provides better performance and more compatibility for filesystem access.  Added support for multi-threading with GIL. Multi-threading is supported in GraalVM’s Python runtime to the same extent as CPython. That is, there is only concurrency, not parallelism for most workloads.  Added support for the current HPy Python C API to run C extensions at better performance. This is an ongoing research project together with members of the PyPy project and the University of Cape Town to provide a faster API for NumPy and other popular Python C extensions.More details are available in the project changelog.R  Upgraded GraalVM’s R runtime to R 4.0.3:          Made the GraalVM R runtime mostly compatible with R 4.0.3;      Migrated to new versions of the base and recommended packages;      Implemented some of the new features of R 4.0.3 (see the changelog for a complete list).        Upgraded the CRAN snapshot, used by default by install.packages, to 2021-02-01:          Support of the new versions of some of the most popular packages on GraalVM’s R runtime is a work in progress;      Packages with known issues remain: dplyr 1.0.3, ggplot 3.3.3, knitr 1.31.      More details are available in the project changelog.WebAssembly (GraalWasm)  Substantially improved the speedup and the overall peak performance of the GraalWasm interpreter by over 10x.  Provided the basic WASI functions that allow manipulating the files and accessing the file system through the Truffle filesystem layer.   GraalWasm is now passing most of the tests in the official WebAssembly test suite.  Improved the speed of the standalone GraalWasm launcher, and the peak performance overall.  Implemented the WebAssembly-JavaScript Interface specification, which allows invoking WebAssembly programs from within JavaScript programs running on GraalVM’s JavaScript runtime.  Implemented parsing custom name sections in the .wasm files to make stack-traces more user-friendly.  Made the GraalWasm interpreter  respect the binary-validation rules.  Introduced checks for memory/table/function count limits when parsing and linking binaries, as defined in the specification.  Added checks to not get exponential compilation slowdown on some pathological code examples.ToolsVisual Studio Code Extensions  Added results visualization for unit tests:  Improved Micronaut support by adding YAML &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Java code editing features:  Added a number of refactorings.  Included Micronaut projects Docker build commands.  Improved support for Maven and Gradle multi-project builds.VisualVM  Added support for upcoming JDK 16 (#260).  Added support for the new Apple M1 processor (aarch64) (#262).  Added support for the importation of plugins from the previous release (#270).  Added a display list of enabled modules in heap dumps feature, taken from JDK 9+ created by jlink (#275).Polyglot Embedding  [GraalVM Enterprise] Added a new experimental sandbox option --sandbox.MaxHeapMemory=&amp;lt;size&amp;gt; that specifies the maximum heap memory that a guest application can retain during its run. This feature is currently only supported on HotSpot. More information on how to use heap memory limits can be found in the sandbox documentation. Note that this feature is still experimental.  Added support for byte buffer-like data structures. This release adds new methods to access buffer values like Value.hasBufferElements(). Java host interoperability was improved to handle java.nio.ByteBuffer implementations to make them work like native guest language buffers. This feature can be enabled and disabled using HostAccess.Builder.allowBufferAccess(boolean). Support for polyglot buffers in languages may vary. See the individual language changelog for more details.  Added support for iterable and iterator-like data structures. This includes new methods to detect if a polyglot value is an iterator or iterable with Value.isIterator() and Value.hasIterator(). New proxy interfaces ProxyIterator and ProxyIterable were added to mimic iterators and iterables. Java host interoperability was improved to handle java.util.Iterator and java.util.Iterable implementations to make them work like guest language values. This feature can be enabled and disabled with HostAccess.Builder.allowIteratorAccess(boolean) and HostAccess.Builder.allowIterableAccess(boolean). Guest language iterators can now also be mapped to Java iterators using Value.as(Iterator.class). The support for this feature in individual languages may vary. See the language changelog for more details.  Added support for map-like data structures (issue #143). This includes new methods for polyglot values like Value.hasHashEntries() to query if a polyglot value represents a hash map like data structure. A new interface ProxyHashMap was added to mimic such values. Java host interoperability was improved to handle java.util.Map implementations to make them look like guest language hash maps. This feature can be enabled and disabled with HostAccess.Builder.allowMapAccess(boolean). Guest language maps can now also be mapped to Java Maps using Value.as(Map.class). The support for this feature in individual languages may vary. See the language changelog for more details.  Added Context.safepoint() to cooperatively poll thread local actions of a polyglot context while a host method is executed. For example, this allows the context to check for interruption or cancellation.A detailed list of all the changes can be found in the changelog.Truffle Language and Tool Implementations  Added support for submitting thread local actions to run at guest language safepoints for language implementations (issue JDK-8263776). Please see the tutorial on how to adapt and use this feature in a language or tool implementation.  Added a new interoperability trait for buffer elements in InteropLibrary that allows better integration with native buffers.  Added a new interoperability type iterator and a new trait for iterable in InteropLibrary to improve traversal of collections between languages.  Added a new interoperability trait for hash entries in InteropLibrary to improve interoperability between guest language hash maps (issue #143).  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.calculateContextHeapSize(TruffleContext, long, AtomicBoolean) to calculate the heap size retained by a context.  Added @GenerateAOT to support preparation for AOT specializing nodes. Read the AOT tutorial to get started with Truffle and AOT compilation. We also added the --engine.CompileAOTOnCreate option to trigger AOT compilation on call target create. More changes and enhancements are planned for the next release.  Added ExactMath.truncate(float) and ExactMath.truncate(double) methods to remove the decimal part (round toward zero) of a float or of a double respectively. These methods are intrinsified.  Added several new events to ContextsListener when language context initialization was completed or failed.  Added CompilerDirectives.isExact(Object, Class) to check whether a value is of an exact type. This method should be used instead of the value != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; value.getClass() == exactClass pattern.  Added Frame.clear(FrameSlot). This allows the compiler to reason about the liveness of local variables. Languages are recommended to use this method when applicable.  Added TruffleLanguage.Env.getLogger(String) and TruffleLanguage.Env.getLogger(Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;) creating a context-bound logger. The returned TruffleLogger always uses a logging handler and options from Env’s context and does not depend on being entered on any thread.  Added TruffleContext.leaveAndEnter(Node, Supplier) to wait for another thread without triggering multithreading.  The native image build now fails for the Truffle languages if a method that is known to be not suitable for partial evaluation is reachable for runtime compilation. The check can be disabled by the -H:-TruffleCheckBlackListedMethods option for the native-image builder.Removed the deprecated TruffleLanguage.Env.getTruffleFile(String), TruffleLanguage.Env.getTruffleFile(URI) methods.  Added TruffleContext.isCancelling() to check whether a Truffle context is being cancelled.  Added new features to the specializing DSL @NodeChild annotation: Added implicit and implicitCreate attributes to allow implicit creation of child nodes by the parent factory method.  Added allowUncached and uncached attributes to allow using @NodeChild with @GenerateUncached.  Profiles now can be disabled using Profile.disable() and reset using Profile.reset().  Added support for two-phase attach in the Truffle instrumentation with the new EventBinding.attach() method.A detailed list of all the changes can be found in the Truffle framework changelog.",

Speedup vs OpenJDK 11The size of the speedup depends on the type of workload.On the Renaissance benchmark suite, which “contains a range of modern workloads, comprising of various popular systems, frameworks and applications made for the JVM”, GraalVM Enterprise achieves a geomean speedup of 1.55x over OpenJDK 8 and similar results for OpenJDK 11.Oracle Cloud InfrastructureBy running the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Monitoring (telemetry) service on GraalVM Enterprise, a 10% transaction processing rate increase was achieved along with a 25% reduction in garbage collection times, a 17% reduction in GC pause times, and a 5% reduction CPU utilization.These improvements have significant benefits for a memory intensive service that routinely processes tens of millions of data points, ingests billions of metrics, and serves millions of requests coming from an ever growing collection of OCI service offerings.Figure 2. OCI Monitoring Service Throughput (transaction per second)Quick startLower infrastructure costsHigher application performance and lower CPU and memory usage are goals every developer strives for.These goals are definitely laudable, and achieving them is easier with GraalVM, but the real value of these improvements is a reduction in the cost to run an application in production.Faster applications with lower resource requirements translate into fewer servers required to deliver a given service, and fewer servers means lower monthly cloud bills and lower capital and operating costs for on premises deployments.The math is straightforward.Even with no reduction in resource requirements, with just a ~11% improvement in throughput, 9 servers can do what required 10 before.That is one less cloud server to pay for or one less datacenter server to buy and maintain.Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition was the performance choice for our Dell EMC Servers. Java workload analysis and SPECjbb®2015 benchmark improving max-jOPS results by almost 8%.— Kurtis Bowman, Director of Architecture, Server Office of the CTO, Dell EMCSomething to Tweet AboutTwitter is one of the most popular social media services in the world running a platform used by millions of users around the globe daily.To keep costs down and performance up, Twitter relies on GraalVM to run core services like Tweet, Social, and News. With the efficiency of the GraalVM JIT compiler, Twitter is able to meet their throughput targets with fewer servers, resulting in significant savings.Being able to see 8–11 percent performance improvements on the same hardware without having to change the underlying code is a once-in-a-lifetime event, leading to substantial cost savings and future flexibility for Twitter.— Chris Thalinger, Staff Software Engineer, TwitterQuick startBetter performance with no code changesWhile the OpenJDK project moves forward with the 6-month release cadence, which offers time-based release model where features get in whenever they are ready, a large part of the Java ecosystem is still using Java 8 and Java 11 in production.GraalVM’s dedication to improving the Java ecosystem comes with support for those major versions which are the most popular.GraalVM includes a compatible JDK and currently offers downloads based on Java 8 or Java 11.To use GraalVM to speed up Java applications, build native executables with the Native Image feature, or incorporate libraries from other languages, you do not have to undergo complex migrations to the latest OpenJDK release.Migrating services to GraalVM mostly consists of replacing the JDK downloads or base container images with the GraalVM based ones without code changes or needing to leverage new language features!Quick startEqually excellent developer productivityOne of the best features of GraalVM is its compatibility with all the tools in the Java ecosystem.GraalVM can run Java applications offering better performance without code changes or any learning curve for developers.GraalVM fits into your workflow, being a compatible JDK it not only runs the applications you are working on, but the Java tools that help you! GraalVM works in your debugger, works with your build tools, it works within your favourite IDE, you can migrate your continuous integration environment to it, run your issue tracker on it and all other Java services you are using.You do not even have to be a Java developer! If other JVM languages are your cup of productivity, that is okay. From Kotlin, to Clojure, to Scala, GraalVM can help you run them all with excellent performance too.GraalVM merges the power of the Java ecosystem and community with a more powerful JDK distribution for the best of all worlds.Quick startSupported by industry-leading Java application frameworksSupported by industry-leading Java application frameworks, GraalVM is often cited as the most exciting innovation in the Java ecosystem.For example, the ability to compile applications into native executables with the Native Image technology revolutionises cloud deployments for Java applications.It is especially important for microservices where individual services are either neatly packed in environments constrained by memory or quickly become a major part of the cloud cost.Luckily, with GraalVM you do not have to rewrite your applications in Go to succeed in the cloud.Most major Java application and microservice frameworks are designed with GraalVM Native Image in mind or are working on adding first-class support.Micronaut, Helidon, Quarkus, or Spring Boot for microservices, PicoCLI for command line applications – whichever task you are facing, there’s a GraalVM Native Image compatible framework available to make your job easier.Quick startExpanding the Java ecosystemThe Java Virtual Machine (JVM) makes it possible to run Java programs on everything from small embedded devices to mainframes.It is a high-performance runtime that abstracts away the details of underlying hardware and operating system platforms to enable code portability.But it turns out the JVM does not actually know anything about the Java language itself as it executes programs compiled to the intermediate Java bytecode format.This means that any language that can be compiled to Java bytecode can be run on the JVM, for example, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure.However, there are many popular languages that do not compile to Java bytecodes and cannot take advantage of the benefits provided by the JVM and the performance benefits of just-in-time compilation.But thanks to the innovative Truffle language implementation framework, GraalVM does support the execution of a number of popular programming languages including JavaScript/Node.js, Ruby, Python, and R on the JVM.There is also support for C, C++, and other languages compiled to LLVM bitcode or WebAssembly (Wasm).GraalVM and Truffle do not just make it possible to run non-Java bytecode programs on the JVM, Truffle also makes it possible for these languages to benefit from GraalVM’s advanced optimizing compiler technology to run faster and leaner — just like Java applications running on GraalVM.In all cases GraalVM Truffle languages perform as fast as, and typically many times faster, on the JVM than they do when running on their original runtimes.TruffleRuby has high potential in speed, as it is nine times faster than CRuby on optcarrot.— Carol Chen, Software Engineer, ShopifyFigure 4. GraalVM Truffle LanguagesBreaking Down WallsIn addition to GraalVM being able to run programs written in a number of languages, it is also possible to run programs that use more than one!There are thousands of useful Node.js packages, Python libraries, and Java libraries that can be used by any of the languages supported by GraalVM.This enables use cases like Java microservices that incorporate Python machine learning capabilities or JavaScript programs that use R for statistical data analysis.GraalVM’s multilingual support makes it possible for developers with different language and domain expertise to collaborate.For example, the Dutch National Police used GraalVM to integrate R code into Spring Boot web services written in Java and Scala.This allowed their data scientists to write code in R to perform data analysis while their Java and Scala developers built out services that interacted with Apache Kafka.Embedding R code in a Scala/JVM project can be an excellent way to use the powerful data processing packages accessible in R… This means you (or your Data Scientist) can use a specialized editor (e.g. RStudio) to create the R side of your functionality, while you can use your own favourite editor for the JVM side (e.g., IntelliJ).— Nathan Perdijk, Scala Developer, CodestarQuick start",

                    "content": "GraalVM Language CompatibilityA key concern when evaluating a new runtime to execute your application is whether theruntime is functionally complete. We run a comprehensive set of language specification testson each push to any of the GraalVM language repositories. Sometimes those test suites areincomplete, in which case we work with third parties to improve the overall ecosystem.We also run regular tests against a subset of popular packages for each of the supportedGraalVM languages. If you are interested in checking if your package is supported, use oneof the two tools below. Specify the name of the module or package you are interested in, or drop in your package.json, Gemfile.lock, or other files containing the list of your dependencies.Note that all the processing is done on the client-side in the browser, no information is sent to any servers.We run tests on the modules from their respective repositories: NPM for node modules, RubyGems for Ruby gems. We try to download the module and run its tests. If the tests pass, the compatibility checker will report the amount of passed tests for the module, for example “100.00% tests pass”. If the tests are not using the testing framework we support running, you will see the “installs but not yet tested” message. Please use the compatibility checker as the initial tool to check the compatibility and assess it further yourself. In general, unless the tests clearly fail, there is a good chance the module will run on GraalVM.            Quickly check if an NPM module or Ruby gem is compatible with GraalVM.                                                            &amp;times;                        Check!                  Sorry, there are no compatibility results found for .        This does not mean  will not work with GraalVM. We just have not had a chance to add it to our regular testing process.          We currently test:            More than 95,000 NPM modules based on mocha, jest, ava, tape, and other test frameworks.      The top 1,000 most popular Ruby gems.

Create a Pull RequestIf you believe your contribution is valuable for others, create a pull request (PR).The common process is forking a repository, submitting a change and creating a PR.When creating a PR, please make sure to include a clear description of the intention of the change, unless the change is self-explanatory, e.g., a version update.Describe why (1) the change or feature is needed, (2) how it is implemented, and, optionally, (3) what further implications it may have.You can either use the PR request description field or the commit message.It is recommended to address one feature or change per PR request.Once you have created a pull request, the Travis CI service will run some sanity checks on your change.Be sure to address any obvious issues caught by these checks (e.g., formatting violation), but keep in mind that test failures may not be directly related to your changes (no gate is perfect due to infrastructure issues and transient test failures).II. Sign the Oracle Contributor AgreementTo allow your pull request to be accepted, you will need to sign the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA).There are two types of OCAs: Individual OCAs and Company OCAs. Sign it online and, once your name or organization shows up in the OCA signatory list, we will add you to the database used to check that pull request authors are covered under the OCA.If it appears to be a delay in your entry showing up in the signatories list, please send an email to oracle-ca_us@oracle.com.If your entry is in the signatories list, but the bot leaves a message on your pull request that you have not signed the OCA, leave a comment on the pull request stating that you are now covered by the OCA.The bot operates from a database separate from the OCA signatories list (since the latter does not necessarily include email details) and must be manually updated.III. Review and MergeAn Oracle employee reviews the proposed change and once the pull request is in a mergeable state, takes responsibility for merging it to the main branch.To ensure extra diligence in terms of verifying externally contributed code meeting these requirements, we have an inbound-check-bot.What to Expect When Submitting a Pull Request?There are many directions to explore from smaller changes like bug fixes or improvements to the API documentation to larger changes that can either speed up theexecution, or give better control over the system.We look forward to extend the GraalVM ecosystem by implementing new languages support with the Truffle framework, providing better tooling for polyglot programming, or proposing new embedding scenarios.The continuous efforts are directed to the machine learning for optimizing compiler configurations.Contributors are welcomed to join the development of a fully meta-circular Java runtime written in Java.We keep on investigating techniques for more efficient memory usage and pursue improving performance for different workloads.To reach GraalVM developers for questions related to working with GraalVM sources, subscribe and post to graalvm-dev@oss.oracle.com.",

Our tooling is built in language-agnostic ways to unify tasks like debugging or profiling.This simplifies deployment and configuration of the runtime environment.Important VM components like the just-in-time-compiler and garbage collector are all fully shared across alllanguages.What does it mean to run any language ‘anywhere’?GraalVM can run embedded in OpenJDK, Oracle JDK or Node.js platforms, standalone, or embedded in data stores like the Oracle Database.In all scenarios, the same underlying compilation and language execution technology runs in-process and with direct access to data structures of the surrounding system.The separation of logical and physical data layout is a first class principle for GraalVM and enables flexible use of data structures without marshalling costs.We encourage the embedding of GraalVM in other projects and publish APIs for that purpose.We envision a future where high-performance and standardized language execution technology is available without the need for provisioning separate VM deployments.Can I use GraalVM with microservices frameworks?GraalVM can run any Java microservices framework.Several Java microservices frameworks have already accepted the GraalVM Native Image technology as a platform.Examples include: Micronaut, Spring, Helidon, Quarkus.For these frameworks Native Image significantly reduces the startup time and runtime memory requirements.Can GraalVM run Spring applications?GraalVM can run Spring applications, compiled with OpenJDK, OracleJDK or other JVMs.Here is a Spring application example that not only runs on GraalVM, but also applies the R language to visualize a plot of the data, using GraalVM polyglot capabilities.Spring Framework support of Native Image is under active development.The Spring Native project provides an incubating support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using GraalVM Native Image, in order to provide a native deployment option designed to be packaged in lightweight containers.In practice, the target is to support a Spring application (typically a Spring Boot one), unmodified, with GraalVM Native Image.What is the status of IDE integration?GraalVM supports major IDEs, as well as major debugging protocols.Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code are possible IDEs since they support all languages within one environment.IntelliJ Enterprise edition has strong support for all languages even within one file.GraalVM provides a built-in implementation of Chrome DevTools Protocol, Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), Language Server Protocol (LSP) which, in addition to debugging JavaScript, even enables debugging of R and Ruby applications, separately or across languages.You can get a multilingual stacktrace that way.What are existing real-world production deployments of GraalVM?Several production deployments of GraalVM exist today.For example, Christian Thalinger from Twitter describes the production deployment of GraalVM at Twitter, how it can help save money via improved performance in his interview Accelerating Processing at Twitter , and how they save money using GraalVM.See others listed in the Use Cases section on GraalVM’s home page.We thank early adopters of our technology who give us feedback on the project and help us develop new features.",

Create the virtual environment with GraalVM:    graalpython -m venv &amp;lt;venv-dir&amp;gt;    Activate the environment in the shell session:    source &amp;lt;venv-dir&amp;gt;/bin/activate  There are not enough standard libraries to run the standard package installers for many packages with GraalVM Python runtime yet.As a convenience, GraalVM’s Python runtime provides a tool called ginstall to install the available packages.To see the list of installable packages, run:graalpython -m ginstall install --helpTo install the package, provide the name:graalpython -m ginstall install &amp;lt;package name&amp;gt;For more information, continue reading to the Installing Supported Packages guide.What to Read NextFor more extensive user documentation, proceed to the Python reference manual.If you consider GraalVM’s Python runtime as a replacement for Jython, consult the Jython Migration guide.The code base of GraalVM’s Python implementation is available on GitHub.",

                    "content": "←BackQuick Start GuideGraalVM is a high-performance runtime for Java and other JVM languages.It contains a compatible JDK and offers distributions based on Java 8 and Java 11.GraalVM comes with multiple compiler optimizations, designed to accelerate Java applications performance while consuming fewer resources.To start using GraalVM, or to migrate from another JDK distribution, you do not have to change any source code.Any application that runs on the Java HotSpot VM will run on GraalVM.Here you will find information about installing GraalVM, running Java applications with it, and adding support for its accompanying features.Further, you will learn how to build platform-specific native executables of Java-based applications.If you are new to GraaVM or have little experience using it, we recommend starting with Architectural Overview of GraalVM.There you will find information about GraalVM’s architecture, distributions available, supported platforms, core and additional features, and much more.Install GraalVMGetting GraalVM installed and ready-to-go only takes a few minutes.1. Navigate to GraalVM Downloads. Be sure to download the package appropriate for your operating system and the Java version you need (Java 8 or 11).2. Unzip the archive to your file system:  on Linux or macOS      tar -xzf &amp;lt;graalvm-archive&amp;gt;.tar.gz    on Windows      unzip &amp;lt;graalvm-archive&amp;gt;.zip  3. Required for macOS only. Move the downloaded package to its proper location, the /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines directory. Since it is a system directory, sudo is required:  sudo mv &amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt; /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachinesTo verify if the move is successful, and to get a list of all installed JDKs, run /usr/libexec/java_home -V.4. Configure the environment variables.  Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to resolve to the installation directory:      #Linux  export JAVA_HOME=&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;      #macOS  export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;/Contents/Home      #Windows  setx /M JAVA_HOME &quot;C:Progra~1Java&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;&quot;    Point the PATH environment variable to the GraalVM bin directory:      #Linux  export PATH=&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;/bin:$PATH      #macOS  export PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH      #Windows  setx /M PATH &quot;C:Progra~1Java&amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;bin;%PATH%&quot;  5. Restart the Command Prompt/Terminal to reload the environment variables. Then use thefollowing command to check whether the variables were set correctly:  on Linux and macOS      echo $PATH  echo $JAVA_HOME    on Windows      echo %PATH%  echo %JAVA_HOME%  6. Optionally, specify GraalVM as the JRE or JDK installation in your Java IDE.Run Java ApplicationsGraalVM includes a JDK based on the Java HotSpot VM, and integrates an optimizing just-in-time (JIT) compiler, written in Java.At run time, an application is loaded and executed normally by the JVM.For demonstration purposes, GraalVM Enterprise based on Java 8 is used.Check your current Java version:java version &quot;1.8.0_281&quot;Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_281-b09)Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM EE 21.0.0 (build 25.281-b09-jvmci-21.0-b05, mixed mode)The java launcher runs the JVM with the GraalVM default compiler - the GraalVM compiler.Take a look at this typical HelloWorld class:public class HelloWorld {  public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);  }}Run the following commands to compile this class to bytecode and then execute it:javac HelloWorld.javajava HelloWorldHello World!Native ImageWith GraalVM Native Image technology you can compile Java bytecode into a platform-specific, self-contained, native executable to achieve faster startup and smaller footprint for your application.Native Image is not available by default, but can be easily added using the GraalVM Updater tool:gu install native-imageThe native-image executable will become available in the &amp;lt;graalvm&amp;gt;/bin directory.Compile the same HelloWorld.java example from above, and then build a native image from Java bytecode:javac HelloWorld.javanative-image HelloWorldThe last command generates an executable file named helloworld in the current working directory.Invoking it executes the natively compiled code of the HelloWorld class as follows:./helloworldHello, World!Note: For compilation, Native Image depends on the local toolchain.Ensure you meet the requirements for your platform.What to Read NextNew UsersSince this Quick Start guide is intended mainly for users new to GraalVM, or userswho are familiar with GraalVM but may have little experience using it, consider investigating more complex Java examples.Oracle Cloud UsersOracle Cloud users considering GraalVM for their cloud workloads areinvited to read GraalVM Enterprise on OCI.This page focuses on using GraalVM Enterprise with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Virtual Machine compute instance.Advanced UsersIf you want more in-depth details about the GraalVM compiler, go to its reference page. For more extensive documentation on running Java, proceed to Java Reference.More detailed documentation on the Native Image technology is available here.If you are looking for the tooling support GraalVM offers, proceed to Debugging and Monitoring Tools.If you are considering GraalVM as a platform for your future language or tool implementation, go to GraalVM as a Platform.You can find information on GraalVM security model, and rich API documentation in GraalVM SDK Javadoc.",

We fixed an issue causing a delay when shutting down the virtual machine process at the end of the execution of an application(see #1140).Native ImageWe improved the structure of the org.graalvm.nativeimage API: classes that canonly be used during image generation are now in the packageorg.graalvm.nativeimage.hosted, to clearly separate them from the classes thatcan be used at image run time. In order to stay backwards compatible, theoriginal classes are still present, but marked as deprecated. They will bedeleted in the next release candidate, so please update to the new classes.We fixed several bugs that were reported on GitHub, including anissue with the logging framework which materialized as an error that no instances of java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter are allowed in the image heap.As a result, native images work now correctly with Helidon, a Javaframework designed for writing microservices which recently announced theirsupport for GraalVM native images:Helidon flies faster with GraalVM.RubyA complete changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Rounding modes have been implemented or improved for Float, Rational, BigDecimal classes (see #1509).  Added a pure-Ruby implementation of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) which passes almost all Ruby FFI specs (see #1529).  The KeyError raised from ENV#fetch and Hash#fetch now matches MRI’s message formatting (see #1633).JavaScriptA complete changelog for the JavaScript component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Loading JavaScript source code from URLs is now guarded by thejs.load-from-url command line option and prohibited by default.RA complete changelog for the R component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Allow parsing any letter in identifiersincluding, e.g., Japanese, with lexer starting from 1.0-RC16, which matchesGNU-R behavior.Python  Improved startup time of the graalpython native launcher.LLVM Runtime  The lli launcher now starts with the locale set to C.1.0-RC15(2019-04-05)JavaBy default,libgraal is nowused when running the java launcher or when using the --jvm mode for thelanguage launchers. The libgraal library is a version of the GraalVM compilerpre-compiled by native-image. In addition to improving startup time, libgraalcompletely prevents the GraalVM compiler from interfering with the heap usage andprofiles of application code. It has execution properties similar to othernative HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2.JavaScript  Enabled Polyglot builtin based on Context.Builder.allowPolyglotAccess().  Added rest and spread properties support for foreign objects. For example, this spread syntax is now supported:    var arr1 = [0, 1, 2];var arr2 = [3, 4, 5];arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // arr1 is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.RNew Features  Implemented gzcon builtin for URL connections.Changes  Truffle interoperability API converts double values to int values if theyfit in the integer range. See the changes in the spectests.Bug Fixes  R incorrectly allowed Java interoperability when not started with --jvm.Starting from 1.0-RC15, --jvm flag is again necessary to enable interoperability with Java.A complete project changelog  is available on GitHub.RubyAn extensive list of changes is available on GitHub.Here is a short list of the most notable ones:Changes  Our experimental JRuby-compatible Java interop has been removed – use Polyglot and Java instead.  Process.clock_getres has been implemented.  debug, profile, profiler, which were already marked as unsupported, have been removed.Bug Fixes  autoload :C, &quot;path&quot;; require &quot;path&quot; now correctly triggers the autoload.  The shell standard library can now be require-d.Compatibility  Improved compatibility with MRI’s Float#to_s formatting #1626.  Added support for the base keyword argument to Dir.{[], glob}.PythonChanges  Migrated to the new Truffle libraries for interoperability support.  Added support for importing Java classes from the java namespace using normal Python import syntax, e.g., from java.util import ArrayList.  Implemented PEP 487 and PEP 560 to make the typing module work.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Interpreter  Added  a preliminary support for bitcode produced by LLVM 8.Native ImageBased on the feedback and bug reports, we improved the agent that traces reflectionand JNI usage on the JavaHotSpot VM. We also changed the implementation languageof the agent from C to Java. The agent is now a Native Image itself.The native-image-maven-plugin now supports multiline buildArgs andboolean parameter skip (skip image building if true).API changes for GraalVM integrators (SDK + Truffle)This version of GraalVM includes a major revision of the TruffleInteroperabilityAPIs.Most existing APIs for Truffle Interoperability were deprecated. Thecompatibility layer may cause significant performance reduction forinteroperability calls. Please see the Interop MigrationGuidefor an overview and individual @deprecated javadoc tags for guidance.We added Truffle Library API that allows language implementations to usepolymorphic dispatch for receiver types with support for implementation specificcaching/profiling with support for uncached dispatch. Please see the TruffleLibraryTutorialfor further details.The numerous changes were introduced to the GraalVM SDK Polyglot API as well:  Renamed Graal SDK to GraalVM SDK.  Experimental options now require --experimental-options on the command line tobe passed to the GraalVM language launchers, orContext.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions andEngine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to be set in other scenarios.For example, to diagnose the memory allocations of a JavaScript application with --memtracer profiling tool,you should prepend --experimental-options option:js --experimental-options --memtracer program.js.  Added a possibility to set an encoding in Source builder.  Added a new API for target type mappings using the new HostAccess API.We summarized all Truffle and SDK changes between GraalVM versions in separate changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsChrome Inspector  Object Preview feature added for GraalVM implementation of JavaScript.  Implemented a Custom Preview experimental feature for all languages supported by GraalVM.Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)Starting with 1.0-RC15 version of GraalVM, Ideal Graph Visualizer will beprovided as standalone download from Oracle Technology Network Downloads page. It is not part of GraalVM Community or Enterprise editions.1.0-RC14(2019-03-18)Introducing --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt;We introduced a uniform --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; which allows to pass options in a uniform way, without knowing which VM mode (--jvm, or --native) will be used. It replaces  --jvm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; and --native.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; command line options, e.g., the option to configure the maximum amount of memory used for the heap --jvm.Xmx=5G becomes --vm.Xmx=5G.This applies to all languages.JavalibgraalThis is the first release to include a prebuilt libgraal shared library. This shared library is produced by the native-image and contains a pre-compiled version of the GraalVM compiler. In addition to improving startup, libgraal completely avoids interfering with the heap usage and profiling of the application code. That is, it has execution properties similar to other native HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2. To try it out, add -XX:+UseJVMCINativeLibrary to your java command line. Note that this is still a work in progress and we are focusing on improving its stability and ensuring it does not compromise peak performance.Default Failure BehaviorThe default behavior has changed for a failure (i.e., uncaught exception) duringthe compilation. These are now silently ignored and nothing is printed to theconsole. To get the old behavior of a message being printed to the console andfor collecting diagnostics about the failure, you now need to specify-Dgraal.CompilationFailureAction=Diagnose option.Native ImagesNew FeaturesWe introduced a tracing agent for the Java HotSpot VM that records usages of reflection and JNI that can then be converted to configuration files for the native image generator. This simplifies the process of getting new applications working as native images. For details, please look at the documentation.We improved support for the java.util.logging API. See the GitHub docs for details.The javax.script.ScriptEngine API is now supported. Please note that the Nashorn JavaScript engine does not work in native images and is therefore always excluded. However, Truffle based language implementations such as the GraalVM JavaScript engine are available when, e.g., the native image is built with the option --language:js.Implemented the Class.getSimpleName method for the native images (see 1020).Bugfixes      Fixed an NPE during native image generation at accessing annotations metadata on the classes opened for reflection (see 1048).        Fixed createTempFile() providing non-default filesystem and failing (see 1035).        Fixed a segfault due to incorrect socket address length value (see 1025).  JavaScriptHTML-like CommentsWe added support for HTML-like comments.var s = &quot;Introducing html-like comments&quot;;alert(s);&amp;lt;!-- this is a comment --&amp;gt;Changes  Renamed the option js.experimental-array-prototype to js.experimental-foreign-object-prototype.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RThe GraalVM implementation of R in this release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.Error PropagationAccording to the R semantics, errors are handled immediately at the point where they are raised. However, in language embedding or polyglot scenarios, it is more useful to have the errors propagate out of the R scope, so that they can be handled correctly. We changed the behavior of FastR in this regard so that now R errors are propagated. Note that this only happens if this is possible without causing unexpected side effect in R code,i.e., if there are no options(error = ...) or on.exit(...) handlers on the stack.Experimental OptionsAll specific options (NOT those GNU-R compatible like --save) are experimental except for --R.PrintErrorStacktracesToFile, which is an option that enables logging of FastR internal errors for bug reporting purposes. Experimental options can be unlocked using --experimental-options or with ContextBuilder#allowExperimentalOptions.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.RubyThis version of GraalVM features new methods implementations and other updates for Ruby implementation.New Features  Implemented Dir.children and Dir#children, String#delete_prefix, #delete_suffix and related methods.Changes  -Xlog= has been removed. Use --log.level= instead.  -J flag has been removed. Use --vm.* instead.  -J-cp lib.jar and similar have been removed. You should use --vm.cp=lib.jar or --vm.classpath=lib.jar instead.  The -X option now works as in MRI.An extensive list of changes is available on GitHub.PythonPython 3.7.0The standard library was updated to Python 3.7.0 from 3.6.5.Changes  Defined a subset of the graalpython launcher options as “stable”. All other options are subject to change and need to be unlocked explicitly on the command line.  Added the support for  -I flag to ignore the user environment and not add the working directory to sys.path.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Various bug fixes.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)New Features  Added Context.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to control whether experimental options can be passed to a Context.  Added Engine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to control whether experimental instrument and engine options can be passed.  The @Option annotation can now specify the stability of an option.  Added engine bound TruffleLogger for instruments. The engine bound logger can be used by threads executing without any context.Changes  Multiple deprecated elements were removed from  the Truffle language implementation framework, i.e., TruffleException.isTimeout, EventBinding.getFilter etc..We summarized GraalVM Truffle and GraalVM SDK changes between GraalVM versions in the separate changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC13(2019-03-05)ToolsIdeal Graph VisualizerWith GraalVM 1.0-RC13 release, there has been a significant change to theIdeal Graph Visualizer developer tool. The default behavior of the Dgraal.Dumpoption has changed in that IGV dumps are now written to the local file system by default.To get the old behavior of dumping straight to an IGV instance listening on 127.0.0.1:4445,you need to add -Dgraal.PrintGraph=Network option.If a network connection cannot be opened, dumping falls back to file system dumping.Graal VisualVMAnother developer tool, Graal VisualVM, now allows Heap monitoring of native-image processes.This functionality is available with GraalVM Enterprise Edition.R  R specific command line options are now passed as –R.PrintErrorStackTracesToFile=true instead of using JVM properties (–jvm.R:+PrintErrorStackTracesToFile). You can view available options with --help:languages.  Optional post installation script, configure_fastr, also regenerates etc/Renviron and etc/ldpaths files according to the target system.  R vectors are not writeable from other languages, because this would violate the R language semantics.A list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available on GitHub.JavaScript  Node.js updated from 10.15.0 to version 10.15.2.  Made JavaScript and Java interoperability available in native images. Note that you have to configure the accessible classes and methods at native image build time (see reflection configuration).  Node.js Worker class should be used instead of deprecated experimental Java.Worker API now.  A deprecated NashornJavaInterop mode was removed.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Added the support for embedded bitcode in Mach-O files. We support bitcode in the __bitcode section of Mach-O object files, as well as bitcode files in an embedded xar archive in the __bundle section of executables or dylibs. For example, on OS X, you can compile your code with clang -fembed-bitcode -flto hello.c -o hello, creating a native executable with embedded bitcode. You can then run it natively (./hello) or with GraalVM ($GRAALVM_HOME/bin/lli ./hello).The full project changelog is available on GitHub.RubyThis release of GraalVM is rich in performance and compatibility improvements,multiple changes and bug fixes for Ruby implementation.An extensive list of all updates is available on  Github.  Here is a short list of most notable ones:New features:  Host interoperability with Java now works on SubstrateVM too.Changes:  -Xoptions has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --help:languages instead.  -Xlog= has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --log.level= instead.  -J has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --jvm. instead.  -J-cp lib.jar and so on have been deprecated and will be removed. Use--jvm.cp=lib.jar or --jvm.classpath=lib.jar instead.  -J-cmd, --jvm.cmd, JAVA_HOME, JAVACMD, and JAVA_OPTS do not work in any releasedconfiguration of TruffleRuby, so have been removed.  -Xoption=value has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --option=value instead.  TracePoint.trace and TracePoint#inspect have been implemented.Compatibility:  Improved the exception when an -S file is not found.  Removed the message from exceptions raised by bare raise to better match MRI #1487.  TracePoint now handles the :class event.Note that GraalVM 1.0-RC13 implementation of Ruby is built on Ruby 2.4.4, and itis still vulnerable to CVE-2018-16395. This will be fixed in the next release.PythonNew feature:  Allow installation of NumPy in a venv. Just run e.g., bin/graalpython -m venv numpy_env; source numpy_env/bin/activate; graalpython -m ginstall install numpy. Note that not all NumPy features work at the moment.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added Debugger.getSessionCount() to return the number of active debugger sessions.  TruffleLanguage class now can register additional services. This change also deprecates the automatic registration of the language class as a service.  OptionCategory.DEBUG has been renamed to OptionCategory.INTERNAL for clarity.  Added static member to class objects that provides access to the class’s static members.  OptionStabilityhas been added for specifying the stability of an option.All GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC12(2019-02-04)Native Image GenerationNative images now check the remaining available stack size on every method call,and throw a StackOverflowError on stack overflows.We continued the work on the support of incomplete classpaths. There were no big changes,but only small bug fixes based on users feedback. The support for incomplete classpathsnow allows to run the native image generator with bytecode verification,i.e., the option --no-verify is no longer passed to the Java HotSpot VMwhen running the native image generator.RAn extensive list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable ones:  FastR now uses the R base function print to implement TruffleLanguage#toString, so that tools and debuggers (like the Chrome Dev Tools console) format values (e.g., data.frame objects) in a familiar, R-like, way.  GraalVM implementation of R provides GNU-R compatible parseData for expressions parsed via parse(...,keep.source=T), which enables packages that use this functionality (like lambda.r and plumber) to work.  Added a dummy implementation of the ALTREP framework to avoid linking problems.JavaScript  Updated Node.js from 10.9.0 to version 10.15.0.  A new option js.experimental-array-prototype added to set prototype of array-like non-JS objects (like ProxyArray or Java List) to Array.prototype. It makes it possible to use functions like map or forEach on these objects directly.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  In order to streamline the polyglot APIs in LLVM Runtime, we deprecated the truffle_* builtin functions. We also broke binary compatibility to bitcode compiled with polyglot.h from version 1.0.0-RC2 (or older).  Read-only globals are now placed in read-only memory. This was necessary to accommodate some changes in mac OS Mojave’s libc that raise errors when format strings are placed in the writable memory.The project changelog is available on GitHub.RubyThis version came with the compatibility improvements:  Change to a new system for handling Ruby objects in C extensions which greatly increases compatibility with MRI.  Support for BigDecimal#to_r was implemented (See #1521).A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.PythonTo see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.  Added support for the __class__ variable in the class scope.  Initial support of the venv standard-library tool, the built-in _bz2 module and the pandas package was started up.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Added the ability to create native image heap dump directly from Graal VisualVM interface.  Improved heap dump support in the native image.1.0-RC11(2019-01-14)Native Image GenerationWe improved the handling of incomplete classpaths, i.e., code that references classes that are not provided on the classpath. The approach we took for RC10 caused problems in corner cases that would have been difficult to fix, therefore we implemented a different approach. Thanks to everyone who tried our initial approach and reported problems on GitHub. We attempted to verify that all reported problems are solved with the new approach.JavaScript  Graal.js only supports ECMAScript 5 (ES5) and newer, and enforces that rule.  Added support for sharing Java objects using the experimental Node.js Worker Threads API.  Added support for ScriptEngine GLOBAL_SCOPE bindings.  Added options to enable/disable several extension features e.g., print() or load().  Added options to disable features for security reasons e.g., eval().More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeGraalVM now reports source filenames and line numbers for LLVM functions in stack traces if the bitcode is compiled with debug information, even if the original source is not available.Find a complete changelog on GitHub.RubyA complete project changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes:  Allowed signal 0 to be used with Process.kill (see #1474).  Implemented Dir.each_child.  Added missing support for the close_others option to exec and spawn.  Implemented the missing MatchData#named_captures method (see #1512).  Process::CLOCK_ constants have been given the same value as in standard Ruby.  All core files now make use of frozen String literals, reducing the number of String allocations for core methods.PythonThe changelog is available on GitHub.  Added the ginstall custom module to install known packages such as NumPy and setup tools using graalpython -m ginstall.  Added support for the yield from syntax.  Added more built-in methods to the time module.  Added support for the standard zipfile module.  Added the built-in _cvs module.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.  Removed the exposure of internal languages through polyglot.eval.R  The R version was upgraded to R-3.5.1.  R does not print or log any details for internal errors unless it is run with  --jvm.DR:+PrintErrorStacktracesToFile.  Newly implemented R native API functions:  Rf_duplicated, Rf_setVar, norm_rand, exp_rand.  Numerous bug fixes.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)Please refer to the project changelogs for a list of APIs changes:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Added CPU monitoring of native-image processes.  Improved the search feature in text views - thread dumps, OQL console results, etc..  Heap viewer is now displaying JVM arguments, has improved performance and memory management.1.0-RC10(2018-12-05)Bug fixes and performance improvements across all GraalVM components.Native Image GenerationAdded a new option --allow-incomplete-classpath with GraalVM 1.0-rc10. By default (without specifying this option), classes that are reachable, but missing on the class path, are reported at native image generation time. When specifying this new option, missing classes are only reported at run time. The option provides support for, e.g., libraries that probe the existence of classes, catch the class loading error, and then fall back to a different behavior. This should result in more applications being able to compile to a GraalVM native image.JavaScriptThe project changelog is available on GitHub.  Added the ability to construct the Java classpath programmatically. If you know at runtime where the classes and jar files are located – you can add them to the classpath and use Java code from them.  Compatibility: added support for several proposals which might become parts of ECMAScript 2019: Array.prototype.{flat,flatMap}, well-formed JSON.stringify, globalThis.  Compatibility: moved several non-standard builtins behind flags (see the  changelog).LLVM Runtime  Improved the debugging experience: internal functions (originating from the GraalVM LLVM interpreter implementation) are now hidden in the stack traces by default and can be debugged with --inspect.Internal; and unhandled exceptions are now output to stderr instead of stdout.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyGraalVM 1.0-rc10 implementation of Ruby comes with several new features and multiple bug fixeswhich can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.  Compatibility: implemented the following API and added libraries:          The nkf and kconv standard libraries were added.      Queue and SizedQueue, #close and #closed?, have been implemented.      Kernel#clone(freeze) has been implemented.      Warning.warn has been implemented.      Thread.report_on_exception has been implemented.        Compatibility: ArgumentError messages now better match MRI.Python  Several users-facing improvements were made to the embedding interfaces: getting/setting the current working directory in Python now uses the appropriate Truffle APIs, Python will report side effects in the KEY_INFO message, and the KEYS message now responds with attributes and methods (not with dict keys).  The interactive help() builtin now works, including asking about language and syntax.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.RMade important steps for compatibility with the R ecosystem:  Improved the support for popular packages: Rcpp modules, dplyr now mostly works,and FastR provides its own version of data.table (work in progress).  A new builtin function install.fastr.packages(pkgs) can be used to install FastR-specific versions of the rJava and data.table packages.  Fixed linking problems on MacOS when installing R packages and using Fortran code.The full changelogis available on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVMSeveral quality of life improvements:  Added the display of system properties for SVM heap dumps.  Added support for the fields histogram and merged references for guest languages: JavaScript, Ruby, and so on.  Improved CPU Sampler accuracy.Ideal Graph Visualizer  The tool understands mx project structure now, e.g., the GraalVM compiler project when opening sources.  Improved performance when laying out large graphs.1.0-RC9(2018-11-05)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Updated based JDK to 8u192. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.RubyGraalVM 1.0-rc9 implementation of Ruby features security updates and multiple bug fixeswhich can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.  Here is a short list of most notable changes:  LLVM for Oracle Linux 7 can now be installed without building from source.  The supported version of LLVM for Oracle Linux has been updated from 3.8 to 4.0.  mysql2 is now patched to avoid a bug in passing NULL to rb_scan_args, and now passes the majority of its test suite.  The post-install script now automatically detects if recompiling the OpenSSL C extension is needed. The post-install script should always be run in TravisCI as well, see the documentation.  Detect when the system libssl is incompatible more accurately and add instructions on how to recompile the extension.Python  Added the support help in the builtin Python shell.  Added readline to enable history and autocompletion in the Python shell.  Add support for the -q, -E, -s, and -S Python launcher flags.  Improved support for string and bytes regular expressions using our TRegex engine.  Started the initial support for the binascii module.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.R  Various improvements in handling of foreign objects in R.  Added missing R builtins and C API: eapply builtin and rapply builtin.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.JavaScriptA complete changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added SourceElement.ROOT and StepConfig.suspendAnchors() to tune debugger stepping.  Added Context.Builder.logHandler and Engine.Builder.logHandler methods to install a logging handler writing into a given OutputStream.  Primitives, host and Proxy values can now be shared between multiple context and engine instances. They no longer throw an IllegalArgumentException when shared.The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Improved Python heapwalker by fixing class names and adding support for PString.  Fixed handling Page Up/Down in ProfilerTreeTable. See GH-109 for details.1.0-RC8(2018-10-19)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Added the support for Intel bit manipulation instructions. For more details, see #666.  Virtualize unsafe compare and swap calls on non-escaping objects. See #636.Maven Artifacts  The com.oracle.truffle group ID was renamed to org.graalvm.truffle.  The graal-sdk, launcher-common and polyglot-tck artifacts were moved from the org.graalvm group ID to org.graalvm.sdk.  New artifacts that are now available:          org.graalvm.compiler:compiler      org.graalvm.js:js      org.graalvm.js:js-launcher      org.graalvm.js:js-scriptengine      org.graalvm.regex:regex      org.graalvm.tools:chromeinspector      org.graalvm.tools:profiler      org.graalvm.truffle:truffle-nfi      com.oracle.substratevm:library-support      com.oracle.substratevm:objectfile      com.oracle.substratevm:pointsto      com.oracle.substratevm:svm-driver      com.oracle.substratevm:svm        The artifacts that are now modular JARs:          truffle-api      graal-sdk      js      js-scriptengine      compiler        The compiler artifact provides the jdk.internal.vm.compiler module and can be used to upgrade that module in JDK 11. Unlike the module present in the JDK, this version contains the optimizing Truffle runtime.Native Image Generation  The native image generator now has automatic support for services loaded using ServiceLoader.All service implementation classes, listed in the META-INF directory, are available automatically as soon as the service interface is used. This eliminates the need to manually register resources and reflection support for such classes. The automatic registration can be disabled with the -H:-UseServiceLoaderFeature option.  Finished the support for isolates (starting multiple independent VM instances at run time) and compressed references (to reduce memory footprint; Enterprise Edition only). More details are in an upcoming blog article.  A new Maven plugin allows native image generation from within a Maven build.  All components necessary for native image generation (Substrate VM and the GraalVM compiler) are now available on Maven Central. The dependency for that is:      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.oracle.substratevm&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;svm&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.0.0-rc8&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 10.9.0.A complete changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.Ruby  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Fedora 28, and macOS 10.14 (Mojave) now supported.  Java.synchronized(object) { } and TruffleRuby.synchronized(object) { } methods have been added.  Added a TruffleRuby::AtomicReference class.  Performance of setting the last exception on a thread has now been improved.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.Python  Python now supports the allocation profiler (--memtracer) to analyze the heap usage of applications.The changelog is available on GitHub.RGraalVM 1.0-rc8 implementation of R came up with multiple bug fixes which can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.ToolsGraal VisualVM  Introduced the CPU and Memory Sampler for guest languages.

Support for https URL connections, see URL-PROTOCOLS.md for more details.JavaScript  Improved support for sharing of shapes between Contexts with the same Engine, which allows to reuse ASTs and objects across different manually created contexts.  Support for BigInteger typed TypedArrays.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe full changelog is available on GitHub.  New polyglot builtin polyglot_has_member.  Removed support for implicit polyglot types for local variables as the availability of type information is not guaranteed. Explicit polyglot casts are now strictly required (polyglot_as_typed). See docs/INTEROP.md and polyglot.h for more details.  Support for IR-level (textual representation of bitcode files) tracing, i.e., creating an execution log of all bitcodes that were executed, for debugging purposes.  Preliminary support for LLVM 7.RubyThe complete changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes.  Useful inspect strings have been added for more foreign objects.  Added the rbconfig/sizeof native extension for better MRI compatibility.  Support for pg 1.1. The extension now compiles successfully, but may still have issues with some datatypes.  readline can now be interrupted by the interrupt signal (Ctrl+C). This fixes Ctrl+C to work in IRB.  Fixed version check preventing TruffleRuby from working with Bundler 2.0 and later.  Removed obsoleted patches for Bundler compatibility now that Bundler 1.16.5 has built-in support for TruffleRuby.  Fixed problem with Kernel.public_send not tracking its caller properlyrb_thread_call_without_gvl() no longer holds the C-extensions lock.  Fixed caller_locations when called inside method_added.  Fixed mon_initialize when called inside initialize_copy.Python  Added support for the re.split builtin.  Enhanced the java interop builtin module with introspection utility methods.  Changes in C extension interface to reduce overhead.The changelogis available on GitHub.R  AWT based graphics devices (jpg, png, X11, …) is supported when running FastR as a native image.  eval.polyglot: the parameter source was renamed to code.  New builtin as.data.frame.polyglot.value creates R data frames from Polyglot objects (KEYS are used as column names, the values must be homogenous arrays, e.g., respond to HAS_SIZE).  Paths in eval.polyglot are resolved relative to the current working directory.  Various fixes necessary to pass dplyr tests (GitHub version of dplyr).More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.ToolsIdeal Graph Visualizer  User can navigate to Javascript (guest language) source from the graph nodes.  Ideal Graph Visualizer prompts to download plugins to support Javascript editing.  Simple scripts (written in Javascript) can be applied on graph data.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  GraalVM SDK and Truffle license changes from GPL2 with Class Path Exception to the Universal Permissive License (UPL). Please refer to the license files for more information: GraalVM Truffle license, GraalVM SDK license.To see the list of changes to the APIs, please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC6(2018-08-31)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  New optimization to remove unnecessary allocation in some calls to Enum.values().  See calls to Enum.values() don’t optimise away as expected for the details.Native Image Generation  Delay class initialization to runtime: By default, all classes that are seen asreachable for a native image are initialized during image building, i.e., theclass initialization method is executed during image building and is not seen asa reachable method at runtime. But for some classes, it is necessary to executethe class initialization method at runtime. This is now possible using the newoption --delay-class-initialization-to-runtime=&amp;lt;comma separate list of classnames&amp;gt; or using the new API RuntimeClassInitialization class.  Direct byte buffer are no longer allowed in the image heap: We added a new verification during image generation to ensure that no direct or mapped byte buffers (MappedByteBuffer instances) are in the image heap. Such buffers have either a pointer to C memory or reference a file descriptor, i.e., native resources that are available during image generation but no longer at image runtime. Using such a buffer would lead to a segfault at runtime. We discovered this issue because Netty has a few direct buffers that are created in class initializers. It is necessary to delay the initialization of such classes to runtime.  Better automatic discovery of classes, methods, and fields accessed via reflection. When String parameters of Class.forName, Class.getMethod, Class.getField, and other similar classes can be constant folded during image generation, then these classes, methods, and fields are automatically registered for reflection usage and do not need to be registered manually on the command line. Constant String parameters are a common pattern to support, e.g., different JDK versions or different library versions where a class, method, or field is not present in all cases and therefore cannot be used directly.LLVM RuntimeThe full changelogis available on GitHub.  Support for LLVM IR-level debugging, i.e., debugging at the level of *.ll instead of *.c files.  New polyglot cast functions for primitive array types, which allows object from other languages to be used like primitive arrays.  Support for function pointer members in polyglot_as_typed, which allows objects from other languages to be used in expressions like obj-&amp;gt;func(args).RubyThe complete changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes.  TruffleRuby is now usable as a JSR 223 (javax.script) language;  A migration guide from JRuby is now included.  The embedded configuration -Xembedded can now be set set on the launcher command line.  Polyglot.export can now be used with primitives and converts strings to Java, when Polyglot.import converts them from Java.  Foreign objects optimisations such as unboxing foreign strings on to_s, to_str, and inspect.  Optimized performance and keyword rest arguments (def foo(**kwrest)).  Multiple bug fixes from user reports.PythonThe full changelog is available on GitHub.  Improved compatibility with regular expressions by including CPython’s sre module as a fallback engine (in addition to Truffle’s regular expression engine).  C extension modules can now be compiled with LLVM 5+, which was prevented by internal incompatibilities before.  Introduced lazy string concatenation to significantly speed up code patterns that repeatedly concatenated strings.  Numerous C-API improvements to extend support for scikit-learn.  Extensions and fixes in various areas: behavior of function and code objects, collections, exception handling during import, type ids, documentation and generators.  Update standard library to CPython 3.6.5.  Enable reuse of ASTs in multiple Contexts (requires the contexts to be created in the same polyglot Engine).RThe full changelogis available on GitHub.  Support for reading/writing graphical parameters via par.  Added numerous builtins to the C API, enabling support for packages like RCurl, rjson, compare, naivebayes, etc.  Added support for formulas that include ....  Various bug fixes: attributes of NULL objects, of CR/LF handling in readLine, La_chol with pivot, warnings/errors in vector coercion.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC5(2018-07-31)GraalVM 1.0-rc5 is the first release where we provide pre-built binaries for GraalVM Community on macOS. As always all binaries are available from the downloads page.KNOWN ISSUES  The GraalVM Community distribution for macOS currently depends on some libraries that are not installed by default on current MacOS versions.This might cause issues with UI-related functionality:    Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib    The necessary components can be added, e.g., by installing https://www.xquartz.org. We will remove this dependency in upcoming versions of GraalVM Community for macOS.  GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  1.0-RC5 includes JVMCI changes necessary to support compiling the GraalVM compiler ahead of time and deploying as a shared library alongside libjvm.so (i.e., libgraal). Note that the implementation of libgraal itself is not a part of this release as it is still under development.Native Image Generation  Added API that allows an application to distinguish between native image building, native image runtime, and regular Java execution. For more information and documentation, look at the class  ImageInfo.JavaScript  Removed legacy NashornExtensions option, use --js.nashorn-compat instead.  Added support for Symbol.prototype.description.  Added support for String.prototype.matchAll.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyThe full changelog is available in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.  Simpler installation on macOS: it is no longer needed to add LLVM (/usr/local/opt/llvm@4/bin) to PATH on macOS.  --log.ruby.level= can be used to set the log level from any language launcher.  String#unpack1 has been implemented.  Optimized required and optional keyword arguments.  -Dtruffleruby.log and TRUFFLERUBY_LOG have been removed - use -Dpolyglot.log.ruby.level.  The custom log levels PERFORMANCE and PATCH have been removed.Python  Generator expressions now properly evaluate their first iterator in the definition scope at definition time.  Fixes for embedders to ensure top scopes are stable and local scopes always contain TruffleObjects.  C-API improvements to support simple Cython modules.  Support recognition of Python source files with the polyglot launcher, so that now --language python is not necessary when starting Python scripts with the polyglot launcher (note that the polyglot launcher still needs to be rebuilt using bin/gu rebuild-images polyglot after installing Python).Full changelog is available on GitHub CHANGELOG.md.RSee CHANGELOG for the list of changes.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.  Support the __builtin_debugtrap function based on LLVM’s @llvmn.debugtrap intrinsic, which can be used to drop into the debugger (e.g., Chrome Inspector).  Support “zero-length array at end of struct” pattern when accessing polyglot values as structs.  Improved performance of global variable access.  Improved support for vectorized bitcode operations generated by clang.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added new execution listener API that allows for simple, efficient and fine-grained introspection of executed code.  Changed the default language context policy from SHARED to EXCLUSIVE, i.e. by default there is one exclusive language instance per polyglot or inner context. This can be configured by the language using the context policy.To see the full list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Graal VisualVM was added to the GraalVM Community distribution.1.0-RC4(2018-07-13)General RemarksWhile we provide updated components for all languages for this rc4 release, only the JavaScript component received fixes from its upstream repository. All other languages are unchanged in terms of functionality.The next release, rc5, is planned for the beginning of August and will provide updates for all components.JavaScriptThe GraalVM JavaScript component has been updated to provide better compatibility with the Nashorn engine. There now is a --nashorn-compat flag to enable backwards compatibility functionality. This flag is highly discouraged for new applications, but can simplify the migration from Nashorn to GraalVM for existing code.  Access getters and setters like fields  Provide Java.extend, Java.super, JavaImporter, JSAdapter  Allow to construct Interfaces or AbstractClasses      Provide top-level package globals java, javafx, javax, com, org, edu    Provide Java.isScriptFunction, Java.isScriptObject, Java.isJavaMethod and Java.isJavaFunctionSome global functions and objects have been added for the scripting mode and can be enabled with the --scripting flag:  Provide $EXEC, $ENV, $ARG, $OPTIONS1.0-RC3(2018-06-29)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Updated the underlying JDK version to “1.8.0_172” from “1.8.0_171”. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Fixed a rare NullPointerException during JVMCI initialization.Native Image Generation  Added support for java.lang.reflect.Proxy supporting both automatic detection and manual configuration. Please refer to the documentation on GitHub for the details.  Added support for Classloader.getResource() and similar methods.  Added support for loading services through theServiceLoader.  Fixed a ClassCastException on generating native images for profile-guided-optimizations (with the --pgo-instrument command line option).JavaScript  Enabled code sharing between Contexts with the same Engine.  Added support for BigInt arithmetic expressions.  Added a flag for the Nashorn compatibility mode --js.nashorn-compat, for the details and migration from Nashorn please refer to the documentation.  Rename the flag for the V8 compatibility mode to js.v8-compat.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyThe full changelog is available in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.  Added ability to call is_a? on foreign objects.  Fixed: Qnil/Qtrue/Qfalse/Qundef can now be used as initial value for global variables in C extensions.  Fixed: SIGPIPE is correctly caught on SubstrateVM, and the corresponding write() raises Errno::EPIPE when the read end of a pipe or socket is closed.  Fixed determining the source encoding for eval() based on the magic encoding comment.Additionally, we implemented a number of performance improvements for stat() related calls, eval(), String substitutions, reading from IO and more.PythonGraalVM Python implementation is still in the early stages, but we’re making progress towards the goal of running applications which use SciPy.  Various C-API improvements allow to run simple NumPy examples.  Implemented buffered I/O and more encodings support, which enables working with files through the standard open function without having to force unbuffered access, and enables working with files that have encodings other than utf-8.  Most math module functions are now implemented and work correctly.  The random module substitute was removed and we now run the standard library random module to be fully compatible.  Improved thread-safety in the embedded scenarios when using Python contexts from multiple threads.More details are available in the project’s changelog on GitHub.R  Added more missing R builtins and C API functions, see CHANGELOG for a complete list.  Simplified installation, the script that configures FastR for the current system  jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr does not require Autotools anymore.  Added configuration files to allow users to build a native image of the FastR runtime, which reduces the startup time. Run jre/languages/R/bin/install_r_native_image to build the image.  Fixed an issue with the plotting window not displaying anything after it was closed and reopened.LLVM Runtime  New builtins polyglot_from_typed and polyglot_as_typed, which can be used to dynamically attach types to polyglot objects.  Implementers of TruffleObject can now respond to the GetDynamicType message to provide a type when an object is accessed from LLVM code.More details are available in the project changelog.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added support for logging in Truffle languages and instruments.  Removed deprecated ResultVerifier.getDefaultResultVerifier API.To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVMWe improved memory footprint and introduced several UI improvements for cleaner more responsive experience of Graal VisualVM. In addition to that, there are the following improvements:  Added recognition of the LLVM Runtime processes.  Improved displaying logical values of guest languages’ objects.  Improved the Object Query Language (OQL) Console for inspecting memory dumps functionality — sorting, filtering, aggregation, unlimited number of results now work.Chrome inspector  Multiple inspector sessions for multiple polyglot engines can run on the same port now.1.0-RC2(2018-06-05)GraalVM for Java Developers  Updated the underlying JDK version to “1.8.0_171” from “1.8.0_161”. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Improved support for the Java Microbenchmark harness. Since JMH 1.21, GraalVM is a recognized and supported JVM.  Fixed a StackOverflow exception an improved performance when recursively inlining of invokedynamic instructions.  Fixed a compiler error causing incorrect code generation while building the scalac compiler.Native Image Generation  Added support for building statically linked native images. Now you can pass --static, and if you have static libc and zlib installed, it generates a standalone executable that will not require libc for running.  Added Classpath exception to the license of SubstrateVM and the Graal compiler components to make sure all GraalVM code ending up in a native image is subject to this clause.  Fixed the handling of implicit exceptions (NullPointerExeption, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException, …): all exceptions now have correct stack traces and can be caught as expected. Previously, implicit exceptions were sometimes not caught by an exception handler within the same method.  Fixed a number of exceptions during the generation of native images that were reported by early adopters.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to 8.11.1 (from 8.9.4), it is not a breaking change, but it brings numerous improvements, including CVE-listed security fixes.LLVM Runtime  Added a new API for accessing Java types and instantiating foreign objects from LLVM languages.Now it is possible to easily call Java code from native programs compiled to the LLVM bitcode. The example below shows how you can access Java’s BigInteger long math operations from C.#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *bigInteger = polyglot_java_type(&quot;java.math.BigInteger&quot;);    void *(*BigInteger_valueOf)(long) = polyglot_get_member(bigInteger, &quot;valueOf&quot;);    void *bi = BigInteger_valueOf(2);    void *result = polyglot_invoke(bi, &quot;pow&quot;, 256);    char buffer[100];    polyglot_as_string(polyglot_invoke(result, &quot;toString&quot;),                       buffer,                       sizeof(buffer),                       &quot;ascii&quot;);    printf(&quot;%sn&quot;, buffer);}If we compile it to the LLVM bitcode, we can execute it with GraalVM. You can see that it computes the value of2^256 which isn’t that easy to do in C otherwise.# shelajev at shrimp.local in /tmp→ clang -c -O1 -emit-llvm -I$GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/llvm big-integer-demo.c# shelajev at shrimp.local in /tmp→ lli --jvm big-integer-demo.bc115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936A more detailed list of changes to the LLVM interpreter can be found in the full changelog.Ruby  We are now compatible with Ruby 2.4.4.  Java.import name imports Java classes as top-level constants.  Coercion of foreign numbers to Ruby numbers now works.  to_s works on all foreign objects and calls the Java toString.  to_str will try to UNBOX and then re-try to_str, in order to provoke the unboxing of foreign strings.Much more details can be found in the full changelog.RAmong the other changes, we improved the stability of GraalVM’s R implementation.  Added a /jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr script that allows FastR’s native build scripts to adopt to the current system, which makes installing R packages much more stable.  The fastr_errors.log file was renamed to fastr_errors_pidXYZ.log and is stored in either initial working directory, the user home directory, /tmp, or the FastR home directory (picking the first location that is writeable). Please add it to the bug reports if you submit issues.Python  Added support for the Python unittest framework.  Python now supports breaking on exceptions and unwinding to stack frames in Chrome inspector.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)Both GraalVM SDK and Truffle are offering API for developers trying to build things on top of GraalVM, language implementations, embedding GraalVM, and so on.  Enabled code sharing between guest language Contexts with the same Engine, speeding up the repeated evaluation of the code.To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsVisualVM  Fixed the issues with loading polyglot heap dumps  fixed executing of scripts in R console  improved recognition of R REPL  fixed loop to nodes  fixed memory leak in child nodes  improved appearance on MacOS  Applicability fixes  added roots histogram for classGraalVM Updater gu  The default operation mode changed from “install from local files” to “install from catalog”.  -c option for installing from the catalog, can be omitted (installing from the catalog the default), but specifying -c still works.

                    "content": "GraalVM is a high-performance runtime that provides significant improvements inapplication performance and efficiency which is ideal for microservices. It isdesigned for applications written in Java, JavaScript, LLVM-based languages suchas C and C++, and other dynamic languages. It removes the isolation betweenprogramming languages and enables interoperability in a shared runtime. It canrun either standalone or in the context of OpenJDK, Node.js or Oracle Database.For Java ProgramsFor existing Java applications, GraalVM can provide benefits by running them faster, providing extensibility via scripting languages, or creating ahead-of-time compiled native images.Run Java FasterGraalVM can run in the context of OpenJDK to make Java applications run faster with a new just-in-time compilation technology. GraalVM takes over the compilation of Java bytecode to machine code. In particular for other JVM-based languages such as Scala, this configuration can achieve benefits, as for example experienced by Twitter running GraalVM in production.The compiler of GraalVM provides performance advantages for highly abstracted programs due to its ability to remove costly object allocations in many scenarios. You can find details in this research paper. Better inlining and more aggressive speculative optimizations can lead to additional benefits for complex long-running applications, see a Stream API example.Whether and how much of a difference GraalVM makes in terms of performance depends of course on the concrete workload. We are interested in receiving any kind of benchmarking results that can help us make GraalVM even faster.Make Your Application ExtensibleGraalVM enables running JavaScript, R, Python, Ruby, LLVM IR and Web Assembly in the context of Java applications. It offers the ability to expose Java data structures to those languages with fine-grained host access filters. The integration is language-agnostic, i.e., an integration for JavaScript can at the later point be also used to execute any other GraalVM-based language. Proxy mechanisms allow mocking up dynamic objects from Java data structures and expose them to the embedded scripts. Take a look at the description on how to make your JVM-based application extensible with GraalVM.Create a Native ImageRunning your application inside a Java VM comes with startup and footprint costs. GraalVM has a feature to create native images for existing JVM-based applications. The image generation process employs static analysis to find any code reachable from the main Java method and then performs full ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. The resulting native binary contains the whole program in machine code form for its immediate execution. It can be linked with other native programs and can optionally include the GraalVM compiler for complementary just-in-time (JIT) compilation support to run any GraalVM-based language with high performance. For additional performance, native images can be built with profile guided optimizations gathered in a previous run of the application. See an example of how to build native images here.For Node.js ProgramsGraalVM can run in the context of Node.js by replacing V8 with GraalVM for executing JavaScript. The main benefits of doing so is to enable polyglot applications (e.g., use Java, R, or Python libraries), run Node.js with large heap configurations and Java’s garbage collectors, or use GraalVM’s interoperability to define data structures in C/C++ and use them from JavaScript.Reuse Libraries from Java, R, or PythonGraalVM enables the use of existing Java libraries or Java frameworks (like Spark or Flink) directly from Node.js. Also, one can use for example R or Python for data science or plotting directly from a JavaScript application. Find an example of a polyglot application here.Run with Large HeapsThe V8 JavaScript engine included in the standard Node.js distribution is tuned for browser configurations and designed to work effectively in small heap scenarios. We enable running Node.js with the heap management of the JVM, opening the ability for large heap configurations and suitable garbage collection settings. The maximum configurable heap size is 32 Gb with compressed 32-bit pointers, and terabytes of heap are supported in the 64-bit pointer configuration.Define Data Structures in C/C++GraalVM allows efficient combination of native code (e.g., written in C/C++) and JavaScript. Native data structures can be directly accessed and the compiler can inline across any boundary. This can be beneficial in a scenario where efficient data structures are managed and allocated in C while other parts of the application are written in Node.js. Find an example of such scenario in the reference manual.For Ruby, R, Python or WebAssemblyRuby, R, Python, WebAssembly are experimental in the GraalVM ecosystem and not recommended for production use at this time, but we are actively working on stability and support for all modules for those languages. At this point in time, we can run simpler applications of Ruby, R, and Python but we do not have the same full compatibility we provide for Java and Node.js applications.WebAssembly currently implements the WebAssembly MVP (Minimum Viable Product) specification and is the youngest language in the GraalVM environment.Apart from the standard GraalVM benefits such as language interoperability (e.g., use Java or JavaScript from those applications), GraalVM can achieve high speedups of 10x or more for those languages. We are happy to assist with making existing Ruby and R applications work with GraalVM, but we cannot guarantee out-of-the-box compatibility for these languages yet.Running in Oracle DatabaseGraalVM is designed for embeddability and can be executed in databases. Ourprototype of the Oracle Database Multilingual Engine (MLE) is availablehere. It allows Oracle Database usersto run JavaScript, using browserify to execute Node.js modules, and to writeextensions in Python.For Microservices FrameworksGraalVM Native Image, currently available as an Early Adopter technology, works with many different Java microservices frameworks.Several projects have already accepted this technology as a platform for theirapplications: Quarkus, Micronaut, Helidon. Also, the Spring Native project provides beta support for compiling Spring applications to native executables using GraalVM Native Image. For these frameworks GraalVM nativeimages significantly reduce the runtime memory requirements compared to runningon HotSpot. We believe that GraalVM Native Image technology can become the bestway for deploying cloud native applications.            ![microservices]({{ “/resources/img/ms_memory_footprint.png”      relative_url }})                  ![microservices]({{ “/resources/img/ms_startup_time.png”      relative_url }})      For Your PlatformWe encourage the development of GraalVM embeddings similar to our ownintegrations in the Oracle Database, OpenJDK, or Node.js. Together with researchcollaboration partners, we already explored ideas of embedding in Spark orFlink. Find a description on how to embed GraalVM in your existing JVM-basedapplication or native application here.For Your Languages and ToolsGraalVM is an open ecosystem and we invite third party systems to participatevia connecting their own programming languages, tools, or platforms.Implement Your Own LanguageThe Truffle language implementation framework (Truffle), allows running programming languages efficiently on GraalVM. It simplifies language implementation by automatically deriving high-performance code from interpreters. You can find details about the approach in this research paper.Implementing your own language using GraalVM will not only give you high performance. More importantly, it allows your language to connect with the rich tooling provided by the GraalVM ecosystem. Also, it enables your language to run in the context of any GraalVM embedding.We developed a demonstration language called “SimpleLanguage” to show the Truffle features. Find out how to get started implementing a language.Create Language-agnostic ToolsGraalVM provides a framework for creating language-agnostic tools like debuggers, profilers, or other instrumentations. GraalVM provides a standardized way to express and run program code enabling cross-language research and the development of tools that are developed once and then can be applied to any language.",
