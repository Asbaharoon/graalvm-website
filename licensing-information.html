<p>This Licensing Information document is a part of the product or program documentation under the terms of your Oracle license agreement and is intended to help you understand the program editions, entitlements, restrictions, prerequisites, special license rights, and/or separately licensed third party technology terms associated with the Oracle software program(s) covered by this document (the &quot;Program(s)&quot;). Entitled or restricted use products or components identified in this document that are not provided with the particular Program may be obtained from the Oracle Software Delivery Cloud website (<a href="https://edelivery.oracle.com" class="uri">https://edelivery.oracle.com</a>) or from media Oracle may provide. If you have a question about your license rights and obligations, please contact your Oracle sales representative, review the information provided in Oracle's Software Investment Guide (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/software-investment-guide/index.html" class="uri">http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/software-investment-guide/index.html</a>), and/or contact the applicable Oracle License Management Services representative listed on <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/license-management-services/index.html" class="uri">http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/license-management-services/index.html</a>.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-product-editions-and-permitted-features">Description of Product Editions and Permitted Features</h2>
<p>Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition consists of the GraalVM Enterprise Core Components and GraalVM Optional Language Packs.</p>

<h3>Early Adopter Technology</h3>
<p>The Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product includes access to the Native Image plugin, which is considered an Early Adopter technology, and is labeled as such in the product documentation.
While the Native Image plugin can be used in production and will be supported by Oracle as part of the Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition subscription, the Native Image plugin is not covered by Oracle's standard warranty.
Additionally, customers using the Native Image plugin need to be prepared to upgrade to the most recent version in the event that Oracle has to make any changes to the technology in order to remain compatible with the Java specifications.
Backports of fixes may also be limited. Oracle is committed to the Native Image plugin technology.</p>

<p>GraalVM Enterprise Core consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GraalVM Compiler  - generates the compiled code to run in either the JavaVM or in our Native Image Virtual Machine</li>
  <li>Support for Java, Scala, Kotlin, JavaScript, Node.js</li>
  <li>Language Implementation Framework - allows implementing any language for the GraalVM environment</li>
  <li><a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM Runtime</a> - allows native code to run in an interpreted environment in GraalVM Enterprise</li>
</ul>

<p>Native Image Plugin provides support for GraalVM Native Image technology in GraalVM Enterprise, that allows scripted applications to be compiled ahead of time into a binary that runs natively on the system.
</p>

<p>GraalVM Enterprise Optional Language Packs provide support for languages in GraalVM Enterprise that are installed separately.</p>

<p>C and C++ languages are supported through the LLVM Interpreter.</p>

<br>
<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<br>   1. Definitions.
<br>
<br>      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br>      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br>
<br>      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br>      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br>
<br>      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br>      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br>      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br>      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br>      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br>      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br>      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br>
<br>      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br>      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br>
<br>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br>      source, and configuration files.
<br>
<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br>      and conversions to other media types.
<br>
<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br>      meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br>          stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br>          the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br>          as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br>      the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>

      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

---- LLVM Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----<br>
<br>
As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions<br>
of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you<br>
may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying<br>
with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.<br>
<br>
In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with<br>
software that is licensed under the GPLv2 ("Combined Software") and if a<br>
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section<br>
3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License<br>
conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and<br>
prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of<br>
the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined<br>
Software.<br>

==============================================================================<br>
Software from third parties included in the LLVM Project:<br>
==============================================================================<br>
The LLVM Project contains third party software which is under different license<br>
terms. All such code will be identified clearly using at least one of two<br>
mechanisms:<br>
1) It will be in a separate directory tree with its own `LICENSE.txt` or<br>
   `LICENSE` file at the top containing the specific license and restrictions<br>
   which apply to that software, or<br>
2) It will contain specific license and restriction terms at the top of every<br>

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
   1. Definitions.<br>
<br>

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br>
<br>
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>
<br>
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br>
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
      source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
<br>

 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
 Version 2, June 1991<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Preamble<br>
 <br>
<br>
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
 using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
 your programs, too.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
 in new free programs;<wbr> and that you know you can do these things.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
 you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
 source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
 rights.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
 distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
 software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
 authors' reputations.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
 patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
 program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
 modification follow.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
 <br>
<br>
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
 under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>
 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
 language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
 the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
 covered by this License;<wbr> they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;<wbr> keep intact all the<br>
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<wbr><br>
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
 along with the Program.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
 <br>
<br>
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
 parties under the terms of this License.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
 License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
 <br>
<br>
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
 sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
 your rights to work written entirely by you;<wbr> rather, the intent is to<br>
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
 collective works based on the Program.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
 the scope of this License.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
 <br>
<br>
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;<wbr> or,<br>
 <br>
<br>
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
 customarily used for software interchange;<wbr> or,<br>
 <br>
<br>
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
 to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
 received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
 <br>
<br>
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
 making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
 control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
 itself accompanies the executable.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
 parties remain in full compliance.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
 signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
 distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
 the Program or works based on it.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
 these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
 this License.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
 excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
 may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
 circumstances.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
 such claims;<wbr> this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
 implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
 system;<wbr> it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
 impose that choice.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
 countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
 of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
 address new problems or concerns.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>
 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
 Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
 Foundation.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
 to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;<wbr> we sometimes<br>
 make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 NO WARRANTY<br>
 <br>
<br>
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
 <br>
<br>
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
 <br>
<br>
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br>
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
 convey the exclusion of warranty;<wbr> and each file should have at least<br>
 the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
 Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
 <br>
<br>
 This program is free software;<wbr> you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
 the Free Software Foundation;<wbr> either version 2 of the License, or<br>
 (at your option) any later version.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;<wbr> without even the implied warranty of<br>
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br>
 GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>
 with this program;<wbr> if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
 when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;<wbr> for details type `show w'.<br>
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
 under certain conditions;<wbr> type `show c' for details.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
 parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may<br>
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c';<wbr> they could even be<br>
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br>
 necessary. Here is a sample;<wbr> alter the names:<br>
 <br>
<br>
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
 `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
 Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
 <br>
<br>
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
 proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
 library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
 Public License instead of this License.</td>

have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.<br>
<br>
The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright Â© 2008<br>
The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD<br>
license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.<br>
<br>
The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is<br>
Copyright Â© 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.<br>
<br>
The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was<br>
originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public<br>

in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.<br>
<br>
The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright Â© 2011<br>

<br>
The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under<br>
the standard MIT terms.<br>
<br>
The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard<br>
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted<br>
by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream<br>
integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.<br>
<br>
The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is<br>
licensed under the standard MIT terms.<br>
<br>
The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,<br>
and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed<br>
under the standard MIT terms.<br>
<br>
All other files which have no copyright comments are original works<br>
produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either<br>
by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more<br>
contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files<br>
can be found in the git version control history of the project. The<br>
omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the<br>
interest of source tree size.<br>
<br>
In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files<br>
(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into<br>
applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit<br>
the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the<br>

<br>
This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of<br>
the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not<br>
to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it<br>
negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of<br>
permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an<br>
obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.<br>

<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>

<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

    Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this<br>
    License.<br>
<br>
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is<br>
    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or<br>
    (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the<br>
    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software<br>
    with other software or devices.<br>
<br>

    Modifications made by that Contributor.<br>
<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
    3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
<br>
    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available<br>
    in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form<br>
    and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms<br>
    of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every<br>
    copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute<br>
    or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such<br>
    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such<br>
    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or<br>
    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br>
<br>
    3.2. Modifications.<br>
<br>
    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are<br>
    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You<br>
    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You<br>
    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br>
<br>
    3.3. Required Notices.<br>
<br>
    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that<br>
    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not<br>
    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained<br>
    within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any<br>
    descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the<br>
    Initial Developer.<br>
<br>
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in<br>
    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of<br>
    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to<br>
    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or<br>
    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.<br>
    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of<br>
    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it<br>
    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or<br>
    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree<br>
    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any<br>
    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a<br>
    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
<br>
    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under<br>
    the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your<br>
    choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br>
    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License<br>
    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to<br>
    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from<br>
    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered<br>
    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make<br>
    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License<br>
    are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or<br>
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and<br>
    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial<br>
    Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br>
<br>
    3.6. Larger Works.<br>
<br>
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with<br>
    other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute<br>
    the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make<br>
    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered<br>
    Software.<br>
<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
    4.1. New Versions.<br>
<br>
    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or<br>
    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be<br>
    given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section<br>
    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify<br>
    this License.<br>
<br>
    4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
<br>
    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the<br>
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the<br>
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If<br>
    the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software<br>
    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available<br>
    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and<br>
    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version<br>
    of the License under which You originally received the Covered<br>
    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or<br>
    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any<br>
    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.<br>
<br>
    4.3. Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new<br>
    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a<br>
    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and<br>
    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to<br>
    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise<br>
    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this<br>
    License.<br>
<br>
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br>
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE<br>
    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR<br>
    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF<br>
    THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE<br>
    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY<br>
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN<br>
    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS<br>
    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to<br>
    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.<br>
    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the<br>
    termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding<br>
    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a<br>
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You<br>
    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the<br>
    Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the<br>
    Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the<br>
    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly<br>
    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or<br>
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the<br>
    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under<br>
    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice<br>
    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the<br>
    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60<br>
    day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant<br>
    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to<br>
    a written agreement with Participant.<br>
<br>
    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br>
    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly<br>
    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by<br>
    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br>
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br>
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>
    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br>
    license.<br>
<br>
    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,<br>
    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any<br>
    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses<br>
    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>
    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE<br>
    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF<br>
    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE<br>
    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR<br>
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br>
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER<br>
    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR<br>
    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE<br>
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT<br>
    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH<br>
    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH<br>
    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR<br>
    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION<br>
    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined<br>
    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer<br>
    software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. <br>
    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"<br>
    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent<br>
    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4<br>
    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software<br>
    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights<br>
    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other<br>
    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer<br>
    software under this License.<br>
<br>
9. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>
    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within<br>
    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,<br>
    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law<br>
    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject<br>
    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and<br>
    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,<br>
    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without<br>
    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.<br>
    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for<br>
    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or<br>
    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be<br>
    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You<br>
    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United<br>
    States export administration regulations (and the export control<br>
    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute<br>
    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.<br>
<br>
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br>
    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br>
    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>
    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>
    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>

<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.<br>
<br>

<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>

***************<br>
<br>
Eclipse Public License - v 2.0<br>
<br>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ('AGREEMENT'). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
1. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
'Contribution' means:<br>
<br>
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
        i) changes to the Program, and<br>
        ii) additions to the Program;<br>
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.<br>
<br>
'Contributor' means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.<br>
<br>
'Licensed Patents' mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
'Program' means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br>
<br>
'Recipient' means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.<br>
<br>
'Derivative Works' shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.<br>
<br>
'Modified Works' shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.<br>
<br>
'Distribute' means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.<br>
<br>
'Source Code' means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
'Secondary License' means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.<br>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.<br>
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
    e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).<br>
<br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:<br>
<br>
    a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and<br>
    b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:<br>
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
        iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and<br>
        iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.<br>
<br>
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:<br>
<br>
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and<br>
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br>
<br>
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (notices) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.<br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ('Commercial Contributor') hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ('Indemnified Contributor') against any losses, damages and costs (collectively 'Losses') arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
7. GENERAL<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.<br>
<br>
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.<br>
Exhibit A  Form of Secondary Licenses Notice<br>
<br>
'This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.'<br>
<br>
    Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.<br>
<br>
    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.<br>
<br>
    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.<br>

<br>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC<br>
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM<br>
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
<br>
   1. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
   "Contribution" means:<br>
<br>
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation<br>
distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
<br>
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
<br>
         i) changes to the Program, and<br>
<br>
         ii) additions to the Program;<br>
<br>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are<br>
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from<br>
a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or<br>
anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions<br>
to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in<br>
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are<br>
not derivative works of the Program.<br>
<br>
   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br>
<br>
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are<br>
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when<br>
combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br>
<br>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including<br>
all Contributors.<br>
<br>
   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br>
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,<br>
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute<br>
and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative<br>
works, in source code and object code form.<br>
<br>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br>
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed<br>
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the<br>
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.<br>
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and<br>
the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,<br>
such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by<br>
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations<br>
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses<br>
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor<br>
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property<br>
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient<br>
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual<br>
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and<br>
licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility<br>
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example,<br>
if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute<br>
the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before<br>
distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright<br>
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth<br>
in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
   3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under<br>
its own license agreement, provided that:<br>
<br>
      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br>
<br>
      b) its license agreement:<br>
<br>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and<br>
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title<br>
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability<br>
and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>
<br>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,<br>
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages,<br>
such as lost profits;<br>
<br>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered<br>
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br>
<br>
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,<br>
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through<br>
a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br>
<br>
   When the Program is made available in source code form:<br>
<br>
      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br>
<br>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br>
<br>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within<br>
the Program.<br>
<br>
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,<br>
if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify<br>
the originator of the Contribution.<br>
<br>
   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with<br>
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is<br>
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor<br>
who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in<br>
a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.<br>
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,<br>
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify<br>
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages<br>
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other<br>
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor<br>
to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor<br>
in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product<br>
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br>
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order<br>
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial<br>
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor<br>
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense<br>
and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate<br>
in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product<br>
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If<br>
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties<br>
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial<br>
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor<br>
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those<br>
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor<br>
to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those<br>
damages.<br>
<br>
   5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON<br>
AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS<br>
OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF<br>
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of<br>
using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its<br>
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the<br>
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage<br>
to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption<br>
of operations.<br>
<br>
   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY<br>
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br>
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION<br>
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,<br>
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY<br>
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS<br>
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
   7. GENERAL<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable<br>
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of<br>
the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto,<br>
such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such<br>
provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself<br>
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes<br>
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section<br>
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to<br>
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and<br>
does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware<br>
of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,<br>
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably<br>
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any<br>
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but<br>
in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only<br>
be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right<br>
to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time<br>
to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this<br>
Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse<br>
Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward<br>
to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given<br>
a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may<br>
always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which<br>
it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,<br>
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)<br>
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)<br>
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property<br>
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,<br>
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under<br>
this Agreement are reserved.<br>
<br>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual<br>
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement<br>
will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the<br>
cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any<br>
resulting litigation.<br>

any special, indirect or consequential damages or any damages<br>
whatsoever resulting from loss of use, data or profits, whether in an<br>
action of contract, negligence or other tortuous action, arising out<br>
of or in connection with the use or performance of this software.<br>
<br>
A large portion of the dictionary entries<br>
originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT<br>
Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.<br>
<br>
Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its<br>
original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED<br>
that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear<br>
on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially<br>
in the same form as set out herein and that such intended<br>
distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise<br>
contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having<br>
jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the<br>
research and development conducted during the project and is provided<br>
to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the<br>
program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,<br>
implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein<br>
includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,<br>
performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of<br>
the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of<br>
any right of any third party.<br>
<br>
Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to<br>
have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for<br>
the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or<br>
otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.<br>
<br>
Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other<br>
organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the<br>
development of the program and their respective officials, directors,<br>
officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all<br>
damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental<br>
and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection<br>
with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material<br>
or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,<br>
regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had<br>
knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the<br>
project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the<br>
foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term<br>
"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,<br>
modification, copying and distribution of the program and the<br>
production of secondary products from the program.<br>
<br>
In the case where the program, whether in its original form or<br>
modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from<br>
any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or<br>
grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in<br>
writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted<br>
from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted<br>
above as far as the program is concerned.<br>

<br>                           Version 2.0, January 2004
<br>                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
<br>
<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<br>   1. Definitions.
<br>
<br>      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br>      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br>
<br>      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br>      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br>
<br>      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br>      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br>      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br>      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br>      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br>      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br>      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br>
<br>      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br>      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br>
<br>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br>      source, and configuration files.
<br>
<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br>      and conversions to other media types.
<br>
<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br>      meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br>          stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br>          the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br>          as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br>      the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.<br>
 #<br>
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its<br>
 #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear<br>
 #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially<br>
 #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended<br>
 #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise<br>
 #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having<br>
 #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.<br>
 #<br>
 #  NO WARRANTY<br>
 #<br>
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the<br>
 #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided<br>
 #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the<br>
 #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,<br>
 #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein<br>
 #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,<br>
 #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of<br>
 #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of<br>
 #  any right of any third party.<br>
 #<br>
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to<br>
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for<br>
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or<br>
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.<br>
 #<br>
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other<br>
 #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the<br>
 #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,<br>
 #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all<br>
 #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental<br>
 #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection<br>
 #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material<br>
 #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,<br>
 #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had<br>
 #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the<br>
 #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the<br>
 #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term<br>
 #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,<br>
 #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the<br>
 #  production of secondary products from the program.<br>
 #<br>
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or<br>
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from<br>
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or<br>
 #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in<br>
 #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted<br>
 #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted<br>
 #  above as far as the program is concerned.<br>

5. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br>
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br>
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br>
Database section 7.<br>
<br>
 # 7.  Database Ownership<br>
 #<br>
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br>
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br>
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br>
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do<br>
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br>
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br>
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA<br>
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br>
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br>
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made<br>
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person<br>
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to<br>
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

<br>     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
<br>     #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
<br>     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
<br>     #
<br>     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
<br>     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
<br>     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
<br>     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
<br>     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
<br>     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
<br>     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
<br>     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
<br>     #
<br>     #  NO WARRANTY
<br>     #
<br>     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
<br>     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
<br>     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
<br>     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
<br>     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
<br>     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
<br>     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
<br>     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
<br>     #  any right of any third party.
<br>     #
<br>     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
<br>     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
<br>     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
<br>     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
<br>     #
<br>     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
<br>     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
<br>     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
<br>     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
<br>     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
<br>     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
<br>     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
<br>     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
<br>     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
<br>     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
<br>     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
<br>     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
<br>     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
<br>     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
<br>     #  production of secondary products from the program.
<br>     #
<br>     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
<br>     #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
<br>     #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
<br>     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
<br>     #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
<br>     #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
<br>     #  above as far as the program is concerned.

<br>    5. Time Zone Database
<br>
<br>      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
<br>    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
<br>    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
<br>    Database section 7.
<br>
<br>     # 7.  Database Ownership
<br>     #
<br>     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
<br>     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
<br>     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
<br>     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
<br>     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
<br>     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
<br>     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
<br>     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
<br>     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
<br>     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
<br>     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
<br>     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
<br>     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

<br>    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
<br>
<br>    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>    Preamble
<br>
<br>    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>    Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>    a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>    Definitions
<br>
<br>        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>        procedures.
<br>
<br>        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>        distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>        Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>        by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>        Holder.
<br>
<br>        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>        configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>        translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>    Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>    will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>    you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>        Version.
<br>
<br>        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>        from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>        under
<br>
<br>            (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>            Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>    or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>    the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>    as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>    terms of this license.
<br>
<br>    General Provisions
<br>
<br>    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,

<br>
<br>The Artistic License 2.0
<br>
<br>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
<br>
<br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>
<br>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>Definitions
<br>
<br>    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>    procedures.
<br>
<br>    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>    distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>    Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>    by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>    Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>    configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>    translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>    Version.
<br>
<br>    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>    from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>    under
<br>
<br>        (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>        Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>
<br>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>terms of this license.
<br>
<br>
<br>General Provisions
<br>
<br>(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
<br>modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
<br>use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
<br>license.
<br>
<br>(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
<br>Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
<br>to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
<br>this license.
<br>
<br>(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
<br>service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
<br>free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
<br>sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
<br>patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
<br>infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
<br>that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
<br>infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
<br>date that such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
<br>THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
<br>IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
<br>NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
<br>LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
<br>BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br>DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
<br>ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

<br>
<br>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

<br>
<br>2. Grant of Copyright License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>
<br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>
<br>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>Definitions
<br>
<br>    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>    procedures.
<br>
<br>    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>    distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>    Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>    by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>    Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>    configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>    translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>    Version.
<br>
<br>    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>    from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>    under
<br>
<br>        (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>        Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>
<br>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>terms of this license.
<br>
<br>
<br>General Provisions
<br>
<br>(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
<br>modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
<br>use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
<br>license.
<br>
<br>(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
<br>Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
<br>to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
<br>this license.
<br>
<br>(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
<br>service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
<br>free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
<br>sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
<br>patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
<br>infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
<br>that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
<br>infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
<br>date that such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
<br>THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
<br>IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
<br>NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
<br>LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
<br>BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br>DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
<br>ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

<br>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
<br>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>
<br>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>
<br>The Artistic License 2.0
<br>
<br>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
<br>
<br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>
<br>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>Definitions
<br>
<br>    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>    procedures.
<br>
<br>    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>    distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>    Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>    by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>    Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>    configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>    translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>    Version.
<br>
<br>    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>    from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>    under
<br>
<br>        (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>        Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>
<br>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>terms of this license.
<br>
<br>
<br>General Provisions
<br>
<br>(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
<br>modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
<br>use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
<br>license.
<br>
<br>(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
<br>Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
<br>to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
<br>this license.
<br>
<br>(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
<br>service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
<br>free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
<br>sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
<br>patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
<br>infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
<br>that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
<br>infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
<br>date that such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
<br>THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
<br>IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
<br>NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
<br>LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
<br>BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br>DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
<br>ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

<br>The Artistic License 2.0
<br>
<br>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
<br>
<br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>
<br>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>Definitions
<br>
<br>    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>    procedures.
<br>
<br>    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>    distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>    Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>    by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>    Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>    configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>    translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>    Version.
<br>
<br>    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>    from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>    under
<br>
<br>        (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>        Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>
<br>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>terms of this license.
<br>
<br>
<br>General Provisions
<br>
<br>(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
<br>modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
<br>use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
<br>license.
<br>
<br>(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
<br>Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
<br>to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
<br>this license.
<br>
<br>(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
<br>service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
<br>free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
<br>sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
<br>patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
<br>infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
<br>that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
<br>infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
<br>date that such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
<br>THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
<br>IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
<br>NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
<br>LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
<br>BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br>DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
<br>ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

<br>
<br>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

<br>
<br>3. Grant of Patent License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
<br>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>

<br>

<br>      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br>
<br>      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br>      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br>
<br>      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br>      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br>      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br>      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br>      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br>      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br>      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br>
<br>      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br>      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br>
<br>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br>      source, and configuration files.
<br>
<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br>      and conversions to other media types.
<br>
<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br>      meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br>          stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br>          the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br>          as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br>      the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br>
<br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br>
<br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br>
<br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

<br>      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br>      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

<br>
<br>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>
<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<br>   1. Definitions.
<br>
<br>      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br>      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br>
<br>      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br>      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br>
<br>      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br>      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br>      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br>      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br>      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br>      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br>      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br>
<br>      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br>      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br>
<br>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br>      source, and configuration files.
<br>
<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br>      and conversions to other media types.
<br>
<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br>      meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br>          stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br>          the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br>          as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br>      the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br>
<br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br>
<br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br>
<br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

<br>
<br>"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries

<br>     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
<br>     #
<br>     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
<br>     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
<br>     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
<br>     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
<br>     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
<br>     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
<br>     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
<br>     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
<br>     #
<br>     #  NO WARRANTY
<br>     #
<br>     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
<br>     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
<br>     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
<br>     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
<br>     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
<br>     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
<br>     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
<br>     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
<br>     #  any right of any third party.
<br>     #
<br>     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
<br>     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
<br>     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
<br>     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
<br>     #
<br>     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
<br>     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
<br>     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
<br>     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
<br>     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
<br>     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
<br>     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
<br>     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
<br>     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
<br>     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
<br>     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
<br>     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
<br>     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
<br>     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
<br>     #  production of secondary products from the program.
<br>     #
<br>     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
<br>     #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
<br>     #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
<br>     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
<br>     #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
<br>     #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
<br>     #  above as far as the program is concerned.

<br>    5. Time Zone Database
<br>
<br>      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
<br>    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
<br>    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
<br>    Database section 7.
<br>
<br>     # 7.  Database Ownership
<br>     #
<br>     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
<br>     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
<br>     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
<br>     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
<br>     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
<br>     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
<br>     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
<br>     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
<br>     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
<br>     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
<br>     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
<br>     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
<br>     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

<br>    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
<br>
<br>    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>    Preamble
<br>
<br>    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>    Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>    a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>    Definitions
<br>
<br>        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>        procedures.
<br>
<br>        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>        distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>        Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>        by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>        Holder.
<br>
<br>        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>        configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>        translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>    Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>    will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>    you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>        Version.
<br>
<br>        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>        from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>        under
<br>
<br>            (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>            Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>    or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>    the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>    as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>    terms of this license.
<br>
<br>    General Provisions
<br>
<br>    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
<br>    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
<br>    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
<br>    license.
<br>
<br>    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
<br>    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
<br>    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
<br>    this license.
<br>
<br>    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
<br>    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
<br>    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
<br>    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
<br>    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
<br>    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
<br>    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
<br>    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
<br>    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
<br>    date that such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
<br>    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS

<br>
<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<br>   1. Definitions.
<br>
<br>      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br>      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br>
<br>      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br>      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br>
<br>      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br>      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br>      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br>      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br>      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br>      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br>      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br>
<br>      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br>      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br>
<br>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br>      source, and configuration files.
<br>
<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br>      and conversions to other media types.
<br>
<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br>      meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br>          stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br>          the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br>          as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br>      the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br>
<br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br>
<br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br>
<br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br>      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br>      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br>      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br>      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br>      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br>      identification within third-party archives.

// on the web and logging all regexp operations performed. Each<br>
// operation is given a weight that is calculated from an estimate of<br>
// the popularity of the pages where it occurs and the number of times<br>

// letters in the data are encoded using ROT13 in a way that does not<br>
// affect how the regexps match their input. Finally the strings are<br>
// scrambled to exercise the regexp engine on different input strings.<br>

distributes such Contribution.<br>
<br>
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br>
<br>
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br>

distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>
Contributor:<br>
<br>
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<wbr><br>
 or<br>
<br>

 Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>
 Version);<wbr> or<br>
<br>
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>

<br>
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br>
<br>
2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>
<br>
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>

equivalents.<br>
<br>
2.7. Conditions<br>
<br>
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br>
in Section 2.1.<br>
<br>
3. Responsibilities<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>
<br>
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br>
Form.<br>
<br>
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>
<br>
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br>
<br>
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>
 Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>
 the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>
 Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>
 than the cost of distribution to the recipient;<wbr> and<br>
<br>
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>
 License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>
 license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>
 the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br>
<br>
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>
<br>
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>
License(s).<br>
<br>
3.4. Notices<br>
<br>
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>
<br>
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>
jurisdiction.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;<wbr> and (b)<br>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Termination<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>
Your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>
2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br>
<br>
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>
prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>

* *<br>
* Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot; *<br>

* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the *<br>
* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a *<br>

* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. *<br>
* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You *<br>
* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, *<br>
* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an *<br>
* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *<br>

* 7. Limitation of Liability *<br>
* -------------------------- *<br>
* *<br>
* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort *<br>
* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any *<br>
* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as *<br>
* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, *<br>
* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character *<br>
* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of *<br>
* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any *<br>

* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This *<br>
* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *<br>
* personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the *<br>
* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *<br>
* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *<br>
* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *<br>
* limitation may not apply to You. *<br>

<br>
8. Litigation<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br>
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br>
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br>
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring<br>
cross-claims or counter-claims.<br>
<br>
9. Miscellaneous<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>

<br>
10.1. New Versions<br>
<br>
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br>

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br>
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br>
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br>
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br>
such modified license differs from this License).<br>

<br>
<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<br>   1. Definitions.
<br>
<br>      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br>      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br>
<br>      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br>      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br>
<br>      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br>      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br>      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br>      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br>      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br>      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br>      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br>
<br>      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br>      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br>
<br>      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br>      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br>      source, and configuration files.
<br>
<br>      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br>      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br>      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br>      and conversions to other media types.
<br>
<br>      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br>      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br>      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br>      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br>
<br>      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br>      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br>      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br>      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br>
<br>      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br>      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br>      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br>      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br>      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br>      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br>      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br>      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br>      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br>
<br>      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br>      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br>      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br>
<br>   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br>      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br>      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br>
<br>   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br>      meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br>
<br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br>          stating that You changed the files; and
<br>
<br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br>          the Derivative Works; and
<br>
<br>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br>          as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br>      the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>
<br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br>
<br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br>
<br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br>
<br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br>
   1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<br>
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br>
<br>
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>
<br>
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<br>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>
<br>
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>
<br>
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<br>
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
      source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
      and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
<br>
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br>
<br>
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include<br>
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate<br>
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a<br>
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the<br>
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier<br>
      identification within third-party archives.<br>

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>
<br>
<br>
"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL<br>
<br>
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making<br>
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of<br>
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.<br>
<br>
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you<br>
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an<br>
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,<br>
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your<br>
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,<br>
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent<br>
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If<br>
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of<br>
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do<br>
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.<br>

<br>
<br>Grant of Copyright License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br>
<br>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
<br>
<br>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br>
<br>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br>

<br>
<br>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	<td>PCRE LICENCE<br>
------------<br>
<br>
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax<br>
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.<br>
<br>
Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as<br>
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"<br>
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data<br>
in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.<br>
<br>
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also<br>
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a<br>
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These<br>
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.<br>

refers to some or all of the team.)<br>
<br>
See the file COPYING for the exact conditions under which you may<br>
redistribute it.  R as a whole is distributed under GPL version 2 or<br>
3: most source files contain a copyright statement allowing use of<br>
that file under GPL version 2 or later: the main exceptions are the<br>
included versions of packages 'MASS', 'class', 'nnet', 'rpart' and<br>
'spatial' (GPL-2 or GPL-3).  (The auxiliary file m4/openmp.m4 is under<br>
GPL-3, but its incorporation into 'configure' is not.)<br>
<br>
The status of files used only in the Windows port is in file<br>
src/gnuwin32/COPYRIGHTS.win, which is appended to this file in binary<br>
Windows distributions.<br>
<br>
Note that almost all the code *is* copyright and may only be<br>
reproduced if the copyright notice (that in the file or this notice)<br>
is preserved.  The status of the included LINPACK routines is unclear:<br>
they are said to be in the public domain in the USA.<br>

Some (but not all) of the public header files are distributed under<br>
the more permissive terms of version 2.1 or later of the LGPL: see<br>
files R_HOME/share/licenses/LGPL-2.1 and R_HOME/share/licenses/LGPL-3.<br>
This applies only to the header files<br>
<br>
src/include/R.h<br>
src/include/Rdefines.h<br>
src/include/Rgraphics.h<br>
src/include/Rinternals.h<br>
src/include/Rmath.h<br>
src/include/S.h<br>
src/include/R_ext/*.h<br>
<br>
Note that it does not apply to the header files such as Rembedded.h<br>
and Rinterface.h used for third-party front ends.<br>
<br>
From the announcement of the change (2001-Feb-05)<br>
<br>
    It came to our attention that some projects are interpreting GPL to<br>
    mean that compiling against the header files or linking against a<br>
    Windows import library brings the compiled code under the scope of<br>
    GPL.  This would mean it would be impossible to distribute binary<br>
    versions of non-GPL packages with compiled code which called entry<br>
    points in the R executable or DLL, of which there are many on CRAN.<br>
<br>
    We encourage packages to be distributed under Open Source conditions,<br>
    but accept that this is not possible for some contributions.  Our<br>
    intention is that export files and import libraries be 'accessors'<br>
    under clause 5 of the LGPL, so that in most cases no (additional)<br>
    restrictions are imposed by compiling a package using the LGPL-ed<br>
    components of R.<br>
<br>
    To avoid any anomalies, the versions of the same files in R versions<br>
    1.0.0 to 1.2.1 may also be used under LGPL or GPL.<br>
<br>
Import libraries are no longer used under Windows.<br>
<br>
Some contributed files are also covered by the Library General Public License.<br>
These include (see also below)<br>

		       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>

<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>
=================================================<br>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
                            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>
   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
That's all there is to it!<br>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.</td>

		       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>
<br>
==============================================================<br>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

	    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.</td>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright  2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as 'you'. 'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.<br>
<br>
A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.<br>
<br>
To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices'to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.<br>
<br>
A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.<br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to 'keep intact all notices'.<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.<br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.<br>
<br>
A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.<br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.<br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. 'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 'copyright' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an 'about box'.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a 'copyright disclaimer' for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.

		       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<br>

<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>

Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
"keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This<br>
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no<br>
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This<br>
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to<br>
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
<br>
Copyright (C)<br>
<br>
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
(at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program. If not, see .<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Copyright (C)<br>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
.<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read<br>
.<br>

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION<br>
<br>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br>
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional<br>
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version<br>
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that<br>
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that<br>
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.<br>
<br>
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of<br>
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled<br>
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of<br>
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the<br>
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.<br>
<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime<br>
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an<br>
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based<br>
on the Runtime Library.<br>
<br>
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without<br>
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of<br>
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any<br>
subsequent versions published by the FSF.<br>
<br>
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,<br>
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with<br>
the license of GCC.<br>
<br>
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual<br>
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for<br>
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution<br>
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br>
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br>
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br>
<br>
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in<br>
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br>
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,<br>
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered<br>
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be<br>
understood as starting with the output of the generators or<br>
preprocessors.<br>
<br>
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or<br>
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any<br>
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to<br>
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an<br>
Eligible Compilation Process.<br>
<br>
1. Grant of Additional Permission.<br>
<br>
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by<br>
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such<br>
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that<br>
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You<br>
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,<br>
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.<br>
<br>
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.<br>
<br>
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general<br>
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft<br>
requirements of the license of GCC.<br>
<br>

<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
<br>
Copyright (C)<br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
(at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
covered by this License.<br>
<br>
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
document.<br>
<br>
4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
covered by this License.<br>
<br>
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
document.<br>
<br>
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
Version.<br>
<br>
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations<br>
below.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it<br>
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must<br>
be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control<br>
compilation and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br>
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least<br>
three years, to give the same user the materials specified in<br>
Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of<br>
performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
Sections above.<br>
<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those<br>
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms<br>
of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.<br>
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most<br>
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should<br>
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full<br>
notice is found.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Copyright (C)<br>
<br>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>
Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or<br>
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,<br>
if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>

GNU Free Documentation License<br>
Version 1.3, 3 November 2008<br>
<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
0. PREAMBLE<br>
<br>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other<br>
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to<br>
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,<br>
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.<br>
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way<br>
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible<br>
for modifications made by others.<br>
<br>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative<br>
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It<br>
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft<br>
license designed for free software.<br>
<br>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free<br>
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free<br>
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the<br>
software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;<br>
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or<br>
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License<br>
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that<br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be<br>
distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a<br>
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that<br>
work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,<br>
refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a<br>
licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you<br>
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission<br>
under copyright law.<br>
<br>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the<br>
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with<br>
modifications and/or translated into another language.<br>
<br>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of<br>
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the<br>
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall<br>
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall<br>
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in<br>
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain<br>
any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical<br>
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,<br>
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding<br>
them.<br>
<br>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles<br>
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice<br>
that says that the Document is released under this License. If a<br>
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not<br>
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero<br>
Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant<br>
Sections then there are none.<br>
<br>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,<br>
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that<br>
the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may<br>
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.<br>
<br>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,<br>
represented in a format whose specification is available to the<br>
general public, that is suitable for revising the document<br>
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of<br>
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available<br>
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or<br>
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input<br>
to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file<br>
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart<br>
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.<br>
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount<br>
of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".<br>
<br>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain<br>
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML<br>
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple<br>
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of<br>
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats<br>
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by<br>
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or<br>
processing tools are not generally available, and the<br>
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word<br>
processors for output purposes only.<br>
<br>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,<br>
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material<br>
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in<br>
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means<br>
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,<br>
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.<br>
<br>
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of<br>
the Document to the public.<br>
<br>
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose<br>
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following<br>
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a<br>
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",<br>
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"<br>
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a<br>
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.<br>
<br>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which<br>
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty<br>
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this<br>
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other<br>
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has<br>
no effect on the meaning of this License.<br>
<br>
2. VERBATIM COPYING<br>
<br>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either<br>
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the<br>
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies<br>
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no<br>
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use<br>
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further<br>
copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept<br>
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough<br>
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.<br>
<br>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and<br>
you may publicly display copies.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY<br>
<br>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have<br>
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the<br>
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the<br>
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover<br>
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on<br>
the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify<br>
you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present<br>
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and<br>
visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.<br>
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve<br>
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated<br>
as verbatim copying in other respects.<br>
<br>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit<br>
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit<br>
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent<br>
pages.<br>
<br>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering<br>
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent<br>
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy<br>
a computer-network location from which the general network-using<br>
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols<br>
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.<br>
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,<br>
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure<br>
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated<br>
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an<br>
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that<br>
edition to the public.<br>
<br>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the<br>
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to<br>
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the<br>
Document.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. MODIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under<br>
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release<br>
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified<br>
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution<br>
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy<br>
of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:<br>
<br>
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct<br>
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions<br>
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section<br>
of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version<br>
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<br>
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities<br>
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified<br>
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the<br>
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),<br>
unless they release you from this requirement.<br>
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the<br>
Modified Version, as the publisher.<br>
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br>
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications<br>
adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br>
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice<br>
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the<br>
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br>
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections<br>
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.<br>
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.<br>
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add<br>
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and<br>
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If<br>
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one<br>
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as<br>
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified<br>
Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br>
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for<br>
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise<br>
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions<br>
it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section.<br>
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at<br>
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original<br>
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br>
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",<br>
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all<br>
the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements<br>
and/or dedications given therein.<br>
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,<br>
unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers<br>
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.<br>
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section<br>
may not be included in the Modified Version.<br>
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"<br>
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<br>
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.<br>
<br>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or<br>
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material<br>
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all<br>
of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the<br>
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.<br>
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.<br>
<br>
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains<br>
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various<br>
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has<br>
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a<br>
standard.<br>
<br>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a<br>
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list<br>
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of<br>
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or<br>
through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already<br>
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or<br>
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,<br>
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit<br>
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.<br>
<br>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License<br>
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or<br>
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS<br>
<br>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this<br>
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified<br>
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the<br>
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and<br>
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its<br>
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.<br>
<br>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and<br>
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single<br>
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but<br>
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by<br>
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original<br>
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.<br>
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of<br>
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.<br>
<br>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"<br>
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled<br>
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",<br>
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections<br>
Entitled "Endorsements".<br>
<br>
<br>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<br>
<br>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other<br>
documents released under this License, and replace the individual<br>
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy<br>
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules<br>
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all<br>
other respects.<br>
<br>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and<br>
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a<br>
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this<br>
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that<br>
document.<br>
<br>
<br>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<br>
<br>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate<br>
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or<br>
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright<br>
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights<br>
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.<br>
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not<br>
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves<br>
derivative works of the Document.<br>
<br>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these<br>
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of<br>
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on<br>
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the<br>
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.<br>
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole<br>
aggregate.<br>
<br>
<br>
8. TRANSLATION<br>
<br>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may<br>
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.<br>
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special<br>
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include<br>
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the<br>
original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a<br>
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the<br>
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include<br>
the original English version of this License and the original versions<br>
of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between<br>
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice<br>
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.<br>
<br>
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",<br>
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve<br>
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual<br>
title.<br>
<br>
<br>
9. TERMINATION<br>
<br>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document<br>
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and<br>
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license<br>
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,<br>
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally<br>
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder<br>
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to<br>
60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does<br>
not give you any rights to use it.<br>
<br>
<br>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the<br>
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions<br>
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in<br>
detail to address new problems or concerns. See<br>
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.<br>
<br>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.<br>
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this<br>
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of<br>
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or<br>
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the<br>
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version<br>
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not<br>
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document<br>
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this<br>
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a<br>
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the<br>
Document.<br>
<br>
11. RELICENSING<br>
<br>
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any<br>
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also<br>
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A<br>
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A<br>
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site<br>
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.<br>
<br>
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0<br>
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit<br>
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,<br>
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license<br>
published by that same organization.<br>
<br>
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in<br>
part, as part of another Document.<br>
<br>
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this<br>
License, and if all works that were first published under this License<br>
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or<br>
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and<br>
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.<br>
<br>
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site<br>
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,<br>
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.<br>
<br>
<br>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents<br>
<br>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of<br>
the License in the document and put the following copyright and<br>
license notices just after the title page:<br>
<br>
Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.<br>
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br>
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3<br>
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br>
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.<br>
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU<br>
Free Documentation License".<br>
<br>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,<br>
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:<br>
<br>
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br>
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br>
<br>
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other<br>
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the<br>
situation.<br>
<br>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we<br>
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of<br>
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,<br>
to permit their use in free software.<br>

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>
<br>
   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
That's all there is to it!<br>

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
  0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
   this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
   d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
       Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
       Version. <br>
<br>
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.</td>

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
 the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
introduced by others.<br>
<br>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
the library.<br>
<br>
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
special circumstances.<br>
<br>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
system.<br>
<br>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
Library.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
these notices.<br>
<br>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
    to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
    specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
the executable.<br>
<br>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
distribute.<br>
<br>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
    Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br>
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br>

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
  0. Additional Definitions. <br>
<br>
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
   this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
   d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
       Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
       Version. <br>
<br>
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.<br>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright  2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as 'you'. 'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.<br>
<br>
A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.<br>
<br>
To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices' to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.<br>
<br>
A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.<br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to 'keep intact all notices'.<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.<br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.<br>
<br>
A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.<br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.<br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. 'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 'copyright' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an 'about box'.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a 'copyright disclaimer' for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.<br>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright  2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as 'you'. 'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.<br>
<br>
A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.<br>
<br>
To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices' to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.<br>
<br>
A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.<br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to 'keep intact all notices'.<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.<br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.<br>
<br>
A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.<br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.<br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. 'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 'copyright' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an 'about box'.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a 'copyright disclaimer' for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.<br>

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
		       Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
			    Preamble<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
    parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>

<br>
			    NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>

========================================<br>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates<br>
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public<br>
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.<br>
<br>
  0. Additional Definitions.<br>
<br>
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
<br>
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
<br>
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
Version".<br>
<br>
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
<br>
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
version:<br>
<br>
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
<br>
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
   this License applicable to that copy.<br>
<br>
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
<br>
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
  4. Combined Works.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
   covered by this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
   document.<br>
<br>
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
<br>
   d) Do one of the following:<br>
<br>
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
       Corresponding Source.<br>
<br>
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
       Version.<br>
<br>
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
<br>
  5. Combined Libraries.<br>
<br>
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
<br>
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
Library.</td>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

Oracle elects the GPLv3. <br>
<br>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>

    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>

<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.</td>

                       Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
                            Preamble<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
  0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
  1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
    "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
    work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
    with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
  7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
    authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
    those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
  8. Termination.<br>
<br>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
  11. Patents.<br>
<br>
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
    (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.</td>

<br>
  Eclipse Public License - v 2.0<br>
<br>
      THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE<br>
      PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION<br>
      OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
<br>
  1. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
  "Contribution" means:<br>
<br>
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content<br>
       Distributed under this Agreement, and<br>
<br>
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>
       i) changes to the Program, and<br>
       ii) additions to the Program;<br>
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from<br>
    and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution<br>
    "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by<br>
    such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.<br>
    Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that<br>
    are not Modified Works.<br>
<br>
  "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.<br>
<br>
  "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which<br>
  are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone<br>
  or when combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
  "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this<br>
  Agreement.<br>
<br>
  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement<br>
  or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.<br>
<br>
  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other<br>
  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the<br>
  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.<br>
<br>
  "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that<br>
  results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the<br>
  contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file<br>
  in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified<br>
  Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,<br>
  interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely<br>
  in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program<br>
  or Modified Works thereof.<br>
<br>
  "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available<br>
  in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.<br>
<br>
  "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making<br>
  modifications, including but not limited to software source code,<br>
  documentation source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
  "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,<br>
  Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any<br>
  exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial<br>
  Contributor.<br>
<br>
  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br>
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright<br>
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,<br>
    publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such<br>
    Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.<br>
<br>
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br>
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent<br>
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,<br>
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,<br>
    if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall<br>
    apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at<br>
    the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition<br>
    of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the<br>
    Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other<br>
    combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is<br>
    licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the<br>
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are<br>
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the<br>
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.<br>
    Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims<br>
    brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual<br>
    property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the<br>
    rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby<br>
    assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual<br>
    property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party<br>
    patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the<br>
    Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license<br>
    before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has<br>
    sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant<br>
    the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
    e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no<br>
    Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than<br>
    those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's<br>
    receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License<br>
    (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).<br>
<br>
  3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
  3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:<br>
<br>
    a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in<br>
    accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany<br>
    the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program<br>
    is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to<br>
    obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily<br>
    used for software exchange; and<br>
<br>
    b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license<br>
    different than this Agreement, provided that such license:<br>
       i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all<br>
       warranties and conditions, express and implied, including<br>
       warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and<br>
       implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness<br>
       for a particular purpose;<br>
<br>
       ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all<br>
       liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,<br>
       incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>
<br>
       iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights<br>
       in the Source Code under section 3.2; and<br>
<br>
       iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any<br>
       party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements<br>
       of this section 3.<br>
<br>
  3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:<br>
<br>
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the<br>
    Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or<br>
    files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial<br>
    Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in<br>
    Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available<br>
    under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and<br>
<br>
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of<br>
    the Program.<br>
<br>
  3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,<br>
  trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations<br>
  of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of<br>
  the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add<br>
  their own appropriate notices.<br>
<br>
  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities<br>
  with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this<br>
  license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,<br>
  the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product<br>
  offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential<br>
  liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes<br>
  the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor<br>
  ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every<br>
  other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,<br>
  damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits<br>
  and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified<br>
  Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such<br>
  Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program<br>
  in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not<br>
  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged<br>
  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified<br>
  Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in<br>
  writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,<br>
  and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any<br>
  related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may<br>
  participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial<br>
  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial<br>
  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance<br>
  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance<br>
  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility<br>
  alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to<br>
  defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance<br>
  claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to<br>
  pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay<br>
  those damages.<br>
<br>
  5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT<br>
  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"<br>
  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br>
  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF<br>
  TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the<br>
  appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all<br>
  risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,<br>
  including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,<br>
  compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs<br>
  or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br>
<br>
  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT<br>
  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS<br>
  SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,<br>
  EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST<br>
  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN<br>
  CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)<br>
  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE<br>
  EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE<br>
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
  7. GENERAL<br>
<br>
  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>
  the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further<br>
  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the<br>
  minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity<br>
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the<br>
  Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software<br>
  or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's<br>
  rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such<br>
  litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it<br>
  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this<br>
  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of<br>
  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's<br>
  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use<br>
  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.<br>
  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses<br>
  granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br>
<br>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,<br>
  but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and<br>
  may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward<br>
  reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of<br>
  this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement<br>
  Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation<br>
  is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the<br>
  responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate<br>
  entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing<br>
  version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be<br>
  Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was<br>
  received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,<br>
  Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its<br>
  Contributions) under the new version.<br>
<br>
  Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient<br>
  receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any<br>
  Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,<br>
  estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted<br>
  under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended<br>
  to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.<br>
  No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.<br>
<br>
  Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice<br>
<br>
  "This Source Code may also be made available under the following<br>
  Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth<br>
  in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),<br>
  version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."<br>
<br>
    Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A<br>
    is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.<br>
<br>
    If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular<br>
    file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE<br>
    file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to<br>
    look for such a notice.<br>
<br>
    You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.<br>
<br>
The complete text of the GNU General Public License v2 is as follows:<br>
<br>
          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
             Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
   Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
            Preamble<br>
<br>
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
  the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
  your programs, too.<br>
<br>
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
  rights.<br>
<br>
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
  distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
  authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow.<br>
<br>
          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
  under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
  refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
  the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
  along with the Program.<br>
<br>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
      parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
      customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
      received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
  special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
  itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
  parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
  this License.<br>
<br>
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
  circumstances.<br>
<br>
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.<br>
<br>
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
  address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
  later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
  Foundation.<br>
<br>
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

<br>
        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
             Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
   Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br>
   as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>
   the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
            Preamble<br>
<br>
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
  Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>
  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br>
<br>
    This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>
  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>
  Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>
  can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>
  this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>
  strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>
  not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>
  for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>
  it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>
  it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>
  these things.<br>
<br>
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>
  rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>
  you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
    For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>
  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>
  you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>
  code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>
  complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>
  with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>
  it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
    We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>
  library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>
  permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br>
<br>
    To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>
  there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>
  modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>
  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>
  author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>
  introduced by others.<br>
<br>
    Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>
  any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>
  effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>
  restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>
  any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>
  consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br>
<br>
    Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>
  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>
  is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>
  this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>
  libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
    When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>
  a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>
  combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>
  General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>
  entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>
  Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>
  the library.<br>
<br>
    We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>
  does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>
  Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>
  of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>
  are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>
  libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>
  special circumstances.<br>
<br>
    For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>
  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>
  a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>
  allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>
  library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>
  case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>
  software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br>
<br>
    In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>
  programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>
  free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>
  non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>
  operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>
  system.<br>
<br>
    Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>
  users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>
  linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>
  that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>
  "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>
  former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>
  be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
<br>
        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
    0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>
  program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>
  other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
  this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>
  prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>
  (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br>
<br>
    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>
  which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>
  Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>
  copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>
  portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>
  straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>
  included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br>
<br>
    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
  making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>
  interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>
  and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
  running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>
  such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>
  on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>
  writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>
  and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>
  <br>
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>
  complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>
  you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>
  all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>
  warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>
  Library.<br>
<br>
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>
  and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>
  fee.<br>
<br>
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>
      in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>
      its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>
      application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>
      root function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
  on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>
  it.<br>
<br>
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
  collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>
  with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
  the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
    3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>
  License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>
  this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>
  that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>
  instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>
  ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>
  that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>
  these notices.<br>
<br>
    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>
  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>
  subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br>
<br>
    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>
  the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
    4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>
  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>
  under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>
  it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>
  must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>
  medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
    If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>
  source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>
  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
    5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>
  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>
  linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>
  work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>
  therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>
  creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>
  contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>
  library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>
  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br>
<br>
    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>
  that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>
  derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>
  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>
  linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>
  threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>
  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>
  functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>
  file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>
  work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>
  Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>
  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>
  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>
  whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>
<br>
    6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>
  link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>
  work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>
  under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>
  modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>
  engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>
  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>
  this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>
  during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>
  copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>
  directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>
  of these things:<br>
<br>
      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>
      changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>
      Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>
      with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>
      uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>
      user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>
      executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>
      that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>
      Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>
      to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
      Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>
      copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>
      rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>
      will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>
      the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>
      interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br>
<br>
      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>
      least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>
      specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>
      than the cost of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>
      from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>
      specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>
      materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>
  Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>
  reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>
  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>
  normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>
  components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>
  which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>
  the executable.<br>
<br>
    It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>
  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>
  accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>
  use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>
  distribute.<br>
<br>
    7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>
  facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>
  library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>
  the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>
  permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br>
<br>
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>
      based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>
      facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>
      Sections above.<br>
<br>
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>
      that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
<br>
    8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>
  the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>
  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>
  rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>
  or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>
  terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
    9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
  distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
  modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
  the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
    10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>
  Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
  original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>
  this License.<br>
<br>
    11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
  may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>
  and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
  integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
  impose that choice.<br>
<br>
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
    12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
  original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>
  an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>
  so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>
  excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>
  written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
    13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>
  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>
  "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>
  conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br>
  license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br>
  the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
    14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br>
  programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br>
  write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br>
  copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br>
  Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br>
  decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br>
  of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br>
  and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
            NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
    15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br>
  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br>
  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br>
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br>
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br>
  LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br>
  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
    16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br>
  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br>
  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br>
  FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br>
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
  LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br>
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br>
  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br>
  DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
<br>
    If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br>
  everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br>
  redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br>
  ordinary General Public License).<br>
<br>
    To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br>
  safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
      <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>
      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br>
      Lesser General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>
      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
<br>
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
  school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br>
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>

Licenses listed below include:<br>
<br>
* GNU General Public License version 3<br>
* Apache 2.0 License<br>
* BSD License<br>
* MIT License<br>
<br>
The complete text of the GNU General Public License version 3 is as follows:<br>
<br>
          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
             Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
   Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
            Preamble<br>
<br>
    The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
  software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
  your programs, too.<br>
<br>
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
  these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
  certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
  you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
  freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
  or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
  know their rights.<br>
<br>
    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
  that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
  authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
  changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
  authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
  modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
  can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
  protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
  pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
  use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
  have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
  products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
  stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
  of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
  States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
  software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
  avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
  make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
  patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
  modification follow.<br>
<br>
             TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
    0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
  works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
 <br>
    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
  on the Program.<br>
<br>
    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
    1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
  form of a work.<br>
<br>
    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
  is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
  subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
  Source.<br>
<br>
    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
  same work.<br>
<br>
    2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
  makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
  measures.<br>
<br>
    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
  technological measures.<br>
<br>
    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
    5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
      it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
      released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
      "keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
      work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
  "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
  parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
  in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
      customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
      with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
      charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
  included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
  product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
  the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
  modification has been made.<br>
<br>
    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
  been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
  protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
  unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
    7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
      authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
      those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
  restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
  governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
  restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
  a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
  License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
  of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
  not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
  where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
  the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
    8. Termination.<br>
<br>
    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
  paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
  your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
  material under section 10.<br>
<br>
    9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
    10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
    11. Patents.<br>
<br>
    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
  purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
  this License.<br>
<br>
    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
  propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
  sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
  patent against the party.<br>
<br>
    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
  license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
  country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
  <br>
    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
  work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
    12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
    13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
  combination as such.<br>
<br>
    14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
  address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
  Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
  by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
  versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
  public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
  to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
    Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
  later version.<br>
<br>
    15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
  PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
  IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
    16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
  THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
  USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
  PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
  SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
    17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
  Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
  copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
  the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
      one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
      (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
      GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
      along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.<br>
<br>
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
    If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
      <program>  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
      This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
  might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>

<br>
    The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
  into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
  may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
  the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
  Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

     source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
     and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
<br>
     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
<br>
  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
<br>
  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
     as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
     meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
         stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
         the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
         as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
     the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>

Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br>
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share<br>
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to<br>
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the<br>
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to<br>
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose<br>
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is<br>
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our<br>
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to<br>
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),<br>
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change<br>
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you<br>
can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny<br>
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions<br>
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the<br>
software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for<br>
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must<br>
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must<br>
show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)<br>
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br>
and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that<br>
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the<br>
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to<br>
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced<br>
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We<br>
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will<br>
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.<br>
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for<br>
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification<br>
follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice<br>
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program<br>
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any<br>
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the<br>
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or<br>
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included<br>
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as<br>
"you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by<br>
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is<br>
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents<br>
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by<br>
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as<br>
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and<br>
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License<br>
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the<br>
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may<br>
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus<br>
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications<br>
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of<br>
these conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating<br>
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or<br>
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be<br>
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of<br>
    this License.<br>
<br>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,<br>
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the<br>
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an<br>
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or<br>
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute<br>
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy<br>
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does<br>
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is<br>
    not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable<br>
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably<br>
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and<br>
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate<br>
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a<br>
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms<br>
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire<br>
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your<br>
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the<br>
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on<br>
the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the<br>
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or<br>
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this<br>
License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under<br>
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and<br>
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source<br>
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above<br>
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to<br>
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically<br>
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the<br>
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1<br>
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to<br>
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only<br>
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in<br>
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with<br>
    Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making<br>
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all<br>
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface<br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation<br>
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code<br>
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either<br>
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)<br>
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source<br>
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though<br>
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as<br>
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,<br>
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate<br>
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or<br>
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so<br>
long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.<br>
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program<br>
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not<br>
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or<br>
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to<br>
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),<br>
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to<br>
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the<br>
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by<br>
third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions<br>
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that<br>
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the<br>
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy<br>
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br>
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.<br>
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution<br>
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through<br>
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and<br>
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or<br>
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this<br>
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software<br>
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many<br>
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software<br>
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to<br>
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that<br>
choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a<br>
consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain<br>
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original<br>
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit<br>
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that<br>
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In<br>
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body<br>
of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the<br>
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in<br>
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems<br>
or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later<br>
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of<br>
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may<br>
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs<br>
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for<br>
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,<br>
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.<br>
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of<br>
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of<br>
software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR<br>
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE<br>
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE<br>
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br>
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND<br>
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br>
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,<br>
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL<br>
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE<br>
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA<br>
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER<br>
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible<br>
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software<br>
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach<br>
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion<br>
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a<br>
pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
<br>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author><br>
<br>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it<br>
    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free<br>
    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)<br>
    any later version.<br>
<br>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT<br>
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or<br>
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for<br>
    more details.<br>
<br>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59<br>
    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it<br>
starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes<br>
    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free<br>
    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;<br>
    type 'show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be<br>
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here<br>
is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
    &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
<br>
    Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public<br>
License instead of this License.<br>
<br>
"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL<br>
<br>
Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are<br>
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but<br>
only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header<br>
the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"<br>
exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."<br>
<br>
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making<br>
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of<br>
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.<br>
<br>
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you<br>
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an<br>
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,<br>
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your<br>
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,<br>
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent<br>
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If<br>
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of<br>
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do<br>
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.<br>

<br>
<br>CC0 1.0 Universal
<br>
<br>    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
<br>    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
<br>    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
<br>    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
<br>    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
<br>    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
<br>    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
<br>    HEREUNDER.
<br>
<br>Statement of Purpose
<br>
<br>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
<br>exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
<br>and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
<br>authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
<br>
<br>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
<br>the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
<br>scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
<br>of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
<br>works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
<br>and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
<br>These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
<br>culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
<br>works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
<br>part through the use and efforts of others.
<br>
<br>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
<br>expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
<br>associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
<br>is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
<br>elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
<br>terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
<br>Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
<br>
<br>1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
<br>protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
<br>Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
<br>limited to, the following:
<br>
<br>  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
<br>     communicate, and translate a Work;
<br> ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
<br>iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
<br>     likeness depicted in a Work;
<br> iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
<br>     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
<br>  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
<br>     in a Work;
<br> vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
<br>     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
<br>     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
<br>     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
<br>     directive); and
<br>vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
<br>     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
<br>     implementations thereof.
<br>
<br>2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
<br>of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
<br>irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
<br>Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
<br>of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
<br>future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
<br>worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
<br>treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
<br>medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
<br>including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
<br>purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
<br>member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
<br>successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
<br>revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
<br>equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
<br>as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
<br>
<br>3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
<br>be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
<br>Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
<br>account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
<br>extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
<br>person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
<br>irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
<br>Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
<br>maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
<br>time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
<br>of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
<br>limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
<br>"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
<br>applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
<br>reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
<br>partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
<br>of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
<br>will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
<br>Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
<br>action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
<br>express Statement of Purpose.
<br>
<br>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
<br>
<br> a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
<br>    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
<br> b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
<br>    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
<br>    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
<br>    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
<br>    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
<br>    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
<br>    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
<br> c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
<br>    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
<br>    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
<br>    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
<br>    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
<br>    Work.
<br> d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
<br>    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
<br>    this CC0 or use of the Work.

<br>                       The Artistic License 2.0
<br>
<br>            Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.
<br>
<br>     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
<br>Preamble
<br>
<br>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
<br>Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
<br>The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
<br>control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
<br>Package available as open source and free software.
<br>
<br>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
<br>license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
<br>terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
<br>make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
<br>a different licensing arrangement.
<br>
<br>Definitions
<br>
<br>    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
<br>    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.
<br>
<br>    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
<br>    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
<br>    procedures.
<br>
<br>    "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
<br>    distribute, or modify the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
<br>    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
<br>    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
<br>    Version, or a Modified Version.
<br>
<br>    "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
<br>    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
<br>    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
<br>
<br>    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
<br>    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
<br>    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.
<br>
<br>    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
<br>    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
<br>    by the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
<br>    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
<br>    Holder.
<br>
<br>    "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
<br>    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
<br>    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
<br>
<br>    "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
<br>    configuration files for the Package.
<br>
<br>    "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
<br>    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
<br>    translation of the Source form.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
<br>
<br>(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
<br>Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
<br>you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
<br>
<br>(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
<br>Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
<br>either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
<br>all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
<br>your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
<br>Compiled form of the Package.
<br>
<br>(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
<br>modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
<br>Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
<br>will be subject to the Original License.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
<br>
<br>(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
<br>or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
<br>Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
<br>from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
<br>any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
<br>you do at least ONE of the following:
<br>
<br>    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
<br>    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
<br>    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
<br>    Version.
<br>
<br>    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
<br>    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
<br>    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
<br>    from the name of the Standard Version.
<br>
<br>    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
<br>    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
<br>    under
<br>
<br>  (i)  the Original License or
<br>
<br>  (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
<br>  modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
<br>  licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
<br>  received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
<br>  Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
<br>  available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
<br>  Fees are allowed.
<br>
<br>
<br>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
<br>or Modified Versions without the Source
<br>
<br>(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
<br>the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
<br>get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
<br>valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
<br>time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
<br>must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
<br>If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
<br>days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
<br>you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
<br>
<br>(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
<br>the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
<br>the Source of the Modified Version.
<br>
<br>
<br>Aggregating or Linking the Package
<br>
<br>(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
<br>Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
<br>aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
<br>Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
<br>components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
<br>apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
<br>as included in the aggregation.
<br>
<br>(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
<br>other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
<br>build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
<br>include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
<br>provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
<br>
<br>
<br>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
<br>
<br>(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
<br>merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
<br>the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
<br>considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
<br>terms of this license.
<br>
<br>
<br>General Provisions
<br>
<br>(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
<br>Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
<br>modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
<br>use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
<br>license.
<br>
<br>(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
<br>Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
<br>to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
<br>this license.
<br>
<br>(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
<br>service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.
<br>
<br>(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
<br>free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
<br>sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
<br>patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
<br>infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
<br>that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
<br>infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
<br>date that such litigation is filed.
<br>
<br>(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
<br>THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
<br>IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
<br>NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
<br>LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
<br>BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
<br>DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
<br>ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 #<br>
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its<br>
 #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED<br>
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear<br>
 #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially<br>

 #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise<br>
 #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having<br>
 #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.<br>
 #<br>
 #  NO WARRANTY<br>
 #<br>
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the<br>
 #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided<br>
 #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the<br>
 #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,<br>
 #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein<br>
 #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,<br>
 #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of<br>
 #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of<br>
 #  any right of any third party.<br>
 #<br>
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to<br>
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for<br>
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or<br>
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.<br>
 #<br>
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other<br>
 #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the<br>
 #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,<br>
 #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all<br>
 #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental<br>
 #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection<br>
 #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material<br>
 #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,<br>
 #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had<br>
 #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the<br>
 #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the<br>
 #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term<br>
 #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,<br>
 #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the<br>
 #  production of secondary products from the program.<br>
 #<br>
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or<br>
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from<br>
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or<br>
 #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in<br>
 #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted<br>
 #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted<br>
 #  above as far as the program is concerned.<br>

5. Time Zone Database<br>
<br>
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br>
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br>
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br>
Database section 7.<br>
<br>
 # 7.  Database Ownership<br>
 #<br>
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF<br>
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br>
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br>
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do<br>
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br>
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br>
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA<br>
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br>
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br>
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made<br>
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person<br>
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to<br>
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the<br>
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw<br>
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.<br>
<br>
In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge<br>
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed<br>
under the Jython specific license below.<br>
<br>
From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed<br>
Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are<br>
covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.<br>
<br>
The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation<br>
license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.<br>
<br>
The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed<br>
under the GNU Public License. The package is now covered by the Jython<br>
Software License.<br>
<br>
The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software<br>
License. See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.<br>

 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>

 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
 as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>

 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>

<br>
 (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br>
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
 as part of the Derivative Works;<wbr> within the Source form or<br>
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;<wbr> or,<br>
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>

 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br>
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>

 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>

 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

Python may include a copy of the OpenSSL libraries, so we include a copy<br>

<p class=MsoNormal>2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice
such that this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>license can be used with materials other than those owned by
the W3C, reflects</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to
this specific</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous
grant of &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Time Zone Database</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time
Zone Database for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is
explained in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database
section 7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. Database Ownership</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an
IETF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly
updated work</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain
in the public</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
not apply</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the
TZ Database,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  the organization that is providing the IANA
Considerations defined in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the
IETF,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent
court</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the
IETF Trust</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  on the database or the code. Any person making a
contribution to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  database or code waives all rights to future claims in
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â Â  contribution or in the TZ Database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of
L. Peter Deutsch,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises
of Menlo Park, CA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
conditions, but instead</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software
Foundation; principally,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that you must include source code if you redistribute it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)Â  However, since
ansi2knr.c is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG
code, this does not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was
produced with GNU Autoconf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
freely distributable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
config.sub,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ltconfig, ltmain.sh).Â  Another support script, install-sh,
is copyright</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG
spec is covered</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.Â  Hence
arithmetic coding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more
licenses.Â  For this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from
the free</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a
marginal gain</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very
many</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware,
there are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>no patent restrictions on the remaining code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and
write GIF files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF
reading support</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.Â  This technique does
not use the LZW algorithm;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are
readable by all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>standard GIF decoders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are required to state that &quot;The Graphics Interchange
Format(c) is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.Â  GIF(sm)
is a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LEGAL ISSUES</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>============</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In plain English:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you
find any bugs,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â please let us know!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You

<p class=MsoNormal>3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you

<p class=MsoNormal>Â you've used the IJG code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and
accuracy.</p>

distribute this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee,
subject to these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>conditions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(1) If any part of the source code for this software is
distributed, then this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>README file must be included, with this copyright and
no-warranty notice</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the
original files</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the
accompanying</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>documentation must state that &quot;this software is based
in part on the work of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Independent JPEG Group&quot;.</p>

the user accepts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the
authors accept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based
on the IJG code,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you
ought to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>acknowledge us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's
name or company name</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products
derived from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it. This software may be referred to only as &quot;the

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of
L. Peter Deutsch,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises
of Menlo Park, CA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
conditions, but instead</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software
Foundation; principally,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that you must include source code if you redistribute it.
(See the file</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is
not needed as part</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not
limit you more than</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the foregoing paragraphs do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was
produced with GNU Autoconf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
freely distributable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
config.sub,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is
copyright</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG
spec is covered by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi. Hence
arithmetic coding cannot</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For
this reason,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over
the unpatented</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations
will support it.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on
the remaining</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and
write GIF files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF
reading support has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been
simplified to produce</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;. This technique does not use
the LZW algorithm; the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
by all standard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GIF decoders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are required to state that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright
property of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property

such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>4. COMMERCIAL
DISTRIBUTION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Commercial
distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>respect to end
users, business partners and the like. While this license is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Contributor
(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>every other
Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>and costs
(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>legal actions
brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>the extent
caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>connection with
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>relating to any
actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>participate in
any such claim at its own expense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>For example, a
Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>offering,
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>that Commercial
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>related to
Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Contributors
related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>court requires
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

apply to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
time the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
grants the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
assurances are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
infringe the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
entity. Each</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
licenses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if
any. For</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>example, if a third party patent license is required to
allow Recipient</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
to acquire</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that license before distributing the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
copyright</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>license set forth in this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*3. REQUIREMENTS*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object
code form</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) its license agreement:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
warranties</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
liability for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
Agreement are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
party; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>iv) states that source code for the Program is available
from such</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
reasonable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy
of the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
contained</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>within the Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of
its</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with respect to end users, business partners and the like.
While this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the
Program, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the
Program in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a commercial product offering, such Contributor
(&quot;Commercial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against
any losses, damages and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims,
lawsuits and other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>legal actions brought by a third party against the
Indemnified</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of
such</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution
of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in
this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any
actual or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
qualify, an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
Commercial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
Commercial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would
have to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
any other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must pay those damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*5. NO WARRANTY*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
IS PROVIDED</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible
for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>determining the appropriateness of using and distributing
the Program</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights
under this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
of program</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss
of data,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
RECIPIENT NOR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
THEORY OF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
(INCLUDING</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
OR</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>*7. GENERAL*</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable under</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without
further action</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
date such</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>litigation is filed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate
if it fails</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of
this Agreement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
distribution</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
Recipient's</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
Recipient</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement
Steward reserves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
suitable separate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
always be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under
which it was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights
or licenses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
All rights in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are
reserved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New
York and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>intellectual property laws of the United States of America.
No party to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than</p>

<h6>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991</h6>

<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</p>

<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.</p>

<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>0</strong>. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.</p>

<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.)</p>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.</p>

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based
on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>

<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>

<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>

<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code
or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>

<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
accompanies the executable.</p>

<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong>. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>. You are not required to accept this License, since you
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong>. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong>. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.</p>

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong>. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong>. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong>. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p><strong>11</strong>. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong>. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p><strong>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</strong></p>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>

<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.</p>

<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Preamble</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The licenses
for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change
it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free
for all its users. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This license,
the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated
software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and
other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you
first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public
License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
explanations below. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>When we speak
of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>To protect
your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>For example,
if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must
give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they
can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and
recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>We protect
your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we
offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>To protect
each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for
the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed
on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version,
so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that
might be introduced by others. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Finally,
software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.
We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a
free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Most GNU
software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General
Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to
certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General
Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit
linking those libraries into non-free programs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>When a
program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library,
the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of
the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits
such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The
Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code
with the library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>We call this
license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>For example,
on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible
use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve
this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library
to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In other
cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a
greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example,
permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more
people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Although the
Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does
ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the
freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the
Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The precise
terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay
close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the
library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains
code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the
library in order to run. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>0.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> This License Agreement applies to any
software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under
the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this
License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>A
&quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use
some of those functions and data) to form executables. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>The
&quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot;
means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&quot;Source
code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code
for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if
its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>1.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> You may copy and distribute verbatim
copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>You may
charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>2.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> You may modify your copy or copies of
the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>a)</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> The modified work must itself be
     a software library.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>b)</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> You must cause the files
     modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and
     the date of any change.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>c)</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> You must cause the whole of the
     work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
     this License.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>d)</span></b><span
     style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> If a facility in the modified
     Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an
     application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument
     passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith
     effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function
     or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
     purpose remains meaningful. </span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>(For example,
a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires
that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must
still compute square roots.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>These
requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of
that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Thus, it is
not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work
written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>In addition,
mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or
with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>3.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> You may opt to apply the terms of the
ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version
2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that
version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Once this
change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the
ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>This option
is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program
that is not a library. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>4.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> You may copy and distribute the
Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>If
distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>5.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> A program that contains no derivative
of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by
being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,
and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>However,
linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The
executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
distribution of such executables. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>When a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>If such an
object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Otherwise, if
the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for
the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work
also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library
itself. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>6.</span></b><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> As an exception to the Sections
above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;
with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>You must give
prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a
copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices,
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things: </span></p>

     linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work

     the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the

these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to

license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>for
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>it
if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>these
things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>rights.Â 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>you
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>you.Â 
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>code.Â 
If you link other code with the library, you must provide</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>complete
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>with
the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>it.Â 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>permission
to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>there
is no warranty for the free library.Â  Also, if the library is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>modified
by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>that
what they have is not the original version, so that the original</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>author's
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>introduced
by others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>any
free program.Â  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>effectively
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>restrictive
license from a patent holder.Â  Therefore, we insist that</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>any
patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>consistent
with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</span></p>

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</span></p>

GNU General Public License.Â  This license, the GNU Lesser</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>General
Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License.Â  We use</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>this

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>General
Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>entire

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>does
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Public
License.Â  It also provides other free software developers Less</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>of
an advantage over competing non-free programs.Â  These disadvantages</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>are
the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>libraries.Â 
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>special
circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>Â 
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>encourage
the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>a
de-facto standard.Â  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>allowed
to use the library.Â  A more frequent case is that a free</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>library
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.Â  In this</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>case,
there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>software
only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</span></p>
